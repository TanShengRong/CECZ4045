Welcome to Minesweeper and CVXFREAK's Silent Hill 2 [Insert Various 
Subtitles Here] FAQ/Walkthough. We hope this walkthrough serves you well 
when it comes to Silent Hill 2. Please note this guide covers:

Silent Hill 2 (PlayStation 2, PC)
Silent Hill 2: Greatest Hits (US PS2)
Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams (Xbox)
Silent Hill 2: Inner Fears (PAL Xbox)
Silent Hill 2: Director's Cut (PAL PS2, PC)
Silent Hill 2: Saigo no Uta (JPN PS2, JPN Xbox)

So, basically, this might contain more information than you really need, 
depending on the version you might have. But, all the versions are 
basically the same so don't worry. You'll be right at home here. If 
you're in need of a bigger story blurb than the one already featured 
here, then go Orca782 and CVXFREAK's Plot Analysis for the Silent Hill 
series.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATES:
(Old updates deleted)

=============
June 30, 2003
=============
UPDATE: (CVXFREAK) I've given this FAQ a bunch of extra information 
throughout most of the sections that were poorly lacking in detail, but 
the walkthrough has stayed intact. 

================
November 2, 2002
================
UPDATE: I added the above disclaimer. There ya go.

===============
August 18, 2002
===============
UPDATE: I (CVXFREAK) changed my e-mail because of the impending doom 
known as Klez. True, they'll probably follow me to my new e-mail address 
but hopefully they won't. Warnings to all of you, if you get pointless 
e-mails that are unbelievably huge, it's Mr. Klez. Don't open them. 

============
July 4, 2002
============
UPDATE: Well, after the fourth Silent Hill 2 game was released in Japan 
today, I gave a major upgrade to all of the FAQS and decided to make 
them all cover EVERY game version possible to maintain some kind of 
order. So, these are all the versions of the game this FAQ/Walkthrough 
cover:

Silent Hill 2
Silent Hill 2: Limited Edition (Japan/PAL Only)
Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams (XBOX)
Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams (Japanese PlayStation 2)

That way, it'll be easier to update.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Controls and Important Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------
PlayStation 2 Versions
----------------------
TRIANGE BUTTON: Map
X BUTTON: Attack/Confirm/Search
SQUARE: Press/Hold to run
O BUTTON: Flashlight Control
D PAD/L3 STICK: Move character
R1: Arm weapon
START BUTTON: Item Screen
SELECT BUTTON: Pause

------------
Xbox Version
------------
Y BUTTON: Map
A BUTTON: Attack/Confirm/Search
WHITE BUTTON: Flashlight Control
BLACK BUTTON: Toggle running and walking/guard attacks
D PAD/LEFT STICK: Move character (Run for the stick)
R: Arm weapon
BACK BUTTON: Item Screen
START BUTTON: Pause

------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT OPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------
Analog Noise
------------
The Analog Noise Screen is the "grain filter" of the game, causing the
blurs of the game to be gone. To get this option, press L1 on the first
option screen.

----------------
Brightness Level
----------------
The brightness level is for making the game dimmer or brighter,
depending on your personal preference. Bright is definitely the better 
option for the darker areas, but may make the foggy areas of the game 
far too bright. 

------------
Auto-Loading
------------
The auto loading of guns is an option, though you might want it off for
the challenge. However, turning this mode off is definitely not 
recommended for speed games as it requires going into the item screen 
manually, which can cause games to take longer than necessary. 

------------
Control Type
------------
The control type lets you choose whether or not you want to use the
standard controls or the controls where you move the direction you push
the D-Pad.

----------------
Language Options
----------------
The language options in the game switch in between Japanese and English. 
If you're fluent in Japanese (NOTE: Primarily uses Katakana and 
Hiragana, but some Kanji is in there), use the Japanese mode and vice 
versa, because Silent Hill 2 is actually a Japanese-developed game. 
There might be some differences in speech in the Japanese language than 
displayed in the English version.  

---------
Subtitles
---------
The subtitles are useful to show the exact speech they're saying. It's 
quite easy to hear them without them, however, so it's entirely up to 
you if you want to use them or not.

----------------------
Stereo or Mono Options
----------------------
The stereo or mono sound is an option, too. Change your sound
preference. I (CVXFREAK) personally prefer stereo sound as it sounds 
clearer and better. Go with either one, though. 

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Storyline
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

In the first Silent Hill, Harry Mason went to the northern area of
Silent Hill to go on vacation with his daughter, Cheryl Mason. With a
dead wife, Harry only had Cheryl. As he drives, he sees a cop pass by 
him. Moments later, the cop's motor bike is off the road without her 
there... 

Upon arrival in SH, a girl in the road causes him to crash his jeep to 
avoid hitting her.

He wakes and sees Cheryl gone, the right passenger seat empty. Searching 
around, Harry sees Cheryl a little bit ahead. He gives chase, but Cheryl 
runs away from Harry, into a dark and gloomy alleyway. Harry chases 
Cheryl through the alleyway and then is "killed" by little zombie 
children. Harry somehow awakes in a cafe with a cop named Cybil Bennett. 
She gives Harry a weapon and tries to find a way out of town.

Harry searches separately, encountering the girl from the road many
times, vanishing before his eyes. It turns dark, light, bloody. The
school and hospital he explores experience that. Dahlia Gilespie, a
girl Harry meets, feeds him information for the town.

Lisa Garland, a nurse and Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a doctor, meet up with
Harry. Harry eventually confronts the REAL enemy, Dahlia and figures
out his daughter, Cheryl, and Alessa, Dahlia's daughter, share one
soul. Cheryl, Harry tells to Cybil after they reunite, that she is
adopted.

Harry is forced to kill his daughter, but Alessa forks over a new one.
Harry, Cybil and the new baby escape, while Lisa and the others aren't
so lucky... Harry and Cybil get out and look at the baby at a cemetery.
Thus their ordeal ends... But even with Samael's literal incarnation 
dead, his spirit and control over Silent Hill continues...

Now...

James Sunderland receives a letter from his wife, dead for 3 years.
Mary. That's her name. James reads the letter... now he travels to 
Silent Hill to find her, wishfully thinking she is alive. What are his
secrets? You'll find out during gameplay...

(Note: Please visit Orca782 and CVXFREAK's Plot Analysis for both Silent 
Hill games for more insight on the story)

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Characters
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

----------------
JAMES SUNDERLAND
----------------
He is the guy you control. Looks A LOT like Ark Thompson from Resident
Evil: Gun Survivor... all the way down to the clothes. He runs slow, but
has a very mature ego. His wife died 3 years ago, like Harry's wife. He
goes to Silent Hill to find out the truth. In terms of gameplay, James 
is easily manipulated, and is not as innocent as you might think he 
would be. During the game, his actions can influence his ending. Will 
you take James down the path of good, or evil? 

-------------
ANGELA OROSCO
-------------
She is looking for her family in SH. She is the first person James
meets. Is she really looking for her family? We'll find out. During the 
course of Silent Hill 2, you'll discover what Angela's past is really 
all about, and what she did many years ago to end up in Silent Hill. She 
gives James an item that will influence one of his endings. Angela is 
actually a far more important character to the story than we think, so 
play to find out!

-----
LAURA
-----
Jerky little girl! She kicks away an important key during the game,
making you do an extra task in the first "building" you explore. How
convenient... Anyway, Laura holds a vital role in the game, having known 
Mary Sunderland, James' dead wife. Laura starts off being a bratty 
little girl who causes James a lot of trouble, but in the end, she 
becomes an extremely endearing character.  

-----
MARIA
-----
She looks and talks like James' wife, Mary. When you meet her, she acts 
very seductive and eventually, she follows James all around Silent Hill. 
You can even shoot her, but the game will end. She has different hair 
and clothing from Mary, but otherwise she is a carbon copy. Her name is 
technically the same. Maria means Mary in Spanish. In the sub-scenario 
for Xbox, PC and Greatest Hits/Director's Cut version of Silent Hill 2, 
we get to control Maria for a short while and discover why she is in 
Silent Hill, and why she looks like Mary. We also discover why Maria has 
memories only Mary experienced.  

---------------
MARY SUNDERLAND
---------------
This is James' dead wife... dead? She can't POSSIBLY write a letter,
unless she somehow obtained a virus from a guy named William Birkin,
which makes her have super powers AND revives her death. But I doubt
it. Mary suffered a long and painful death, and now her memory is in 
Silent Hill, drawing James in to town. Is she really alive, waiting in 
their "special place?" Play the game to find out the shocking truth.

----------------
EDDIE DOMBROWSKI
----------------
Whose side is this guy on? Well, when we first meet him, he is busy 
vomiting very badly. He says he never killed anyone, though there is a 
dead body in his apartment room. Did he? You'll find out. What is he 
doing in SH? We'll find out. Eddie becomes one of the bosses we face in 
Silent Hill, actually. Besides that, Eddie comes off as very ignorant 
and troubled, as well. 

--------------
ERNEST BALDWIN
--------------
Featured only in Maria's scenario, Ernest is quite the mysterious man. 
His daughter died several years ago and since then he's been very 
disconnected with the world in general. Over these last few years, 
Ernest has been trying to find a way to get his daughter back. Ernest 
also knows the true, definitive reason why Maria even exists. He doesn't 
do much else to the plot, other than have Maria reveal her true motives 
for existing in Silent Hill. His face is never seen in the game at all. 

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Walkthrough
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
LETTER FROM SILENT HEAVEN WALKTHROUGH
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A man looks at himself in a dirty mirror.  He asks himself the question:  
"Mary, could you really be in this town?"  His name is James Sunderland, 
and he has come here to Silent Hill to look for his wife.

=======================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENTERING TOWN
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================

[NOTE: For the course of the game, maps will be VERY important. Use it
when navigating. When I say "head into Sanders Street", use the map to
get to it.]

REST STOP BATHROOM
After James asks himself the question above, leave the bathroom.  You 
won't find anything other than the filth that's usually in public 
bathrooms, unless you're playing Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams (XBOX or 
the Japanese PS2). If you're playing with a Restless Dreams game, look 
around for a BLUE GEM. It will give Restless Dreams owners a chance to 
achieve a newer ending. 

REST STOP
James will walk over to the railing bordering the forest and lean on it.  
He'll begin thinking lots of things to himself, like the words of his 
wife's letter, who's supposed to be dead!

James thinks of her words "I'm alone there now, in our special place."  
He wonders if she really is there, and what she meant by their "special 
place," because the whole town is supposed to be their special place.  
James decides that it's probably the park, because they spent one whole 
afternoon there. Your first major objective then should be to get to 
that park.

When James finishes talking to himself, search the blue car, which I 
guess is James's car, and get the MAP OF SILENT HILL.  You need it and 
you won't be allowed to leave this area without it anyway.  After 
collecting the map, go down the stairs marked "TOLUCA LAKE" to the 
northwest.

(BTW, enjoy the clear surroundings now, because for most of the rest of 
the game you'll be surrounded in a claustrophobic fog.)

FOREST
Follow the path.  You can hear a wolf or something barking occasionally, 
but don't worry, because nothing will attack you.  Part of the way down 
you'll find a well.  Look inside and you'll see a strange red object.  
These red things are what you will use for your SAVE POINTs.  Shortly 
after passing the well, you'll come to some big iron gates.  Go through 
them.

GRAVEYARD
Walk down the path and into the graveyard.  Here you will meet Angela.  
James asks her if he's going the right way to Silent Hill, and she says 
yes. As he starts to walk away, Angela warns him that there's something 
wrong with this town, and it might be dangerous.  James says he doesn't 
really care and he's going anyway.

She asks why, and he says he's looking for somebody important to him.  
She says she came here looking for her mother, and really wants to see 
her again. They both say that they hope they each find who they are 
looking for, and then James walks away.  Head through the gate to the 
west, past the chapel.

WILTSE ROAD
Walk down the gravel road, past Silent Hill Ranch and some other random 
things. You'll come to a small 
concrete tunnel with a gate in it.  Go 
through the gate.

EASTERN SILENT HILL
Walk down the remainder of Wilste Road.  I wonder how they manage to get 
cars running both ways down this tiny little street.  You'll come out on 
Sanders Street.  Across the street from you is the Flower Shop.  Search 
the table to the left of the shop to find a FIRST-AID KIT.

Proceed west down Sanders Street.  When you arrive at the intersection 
of Sanders and Lindsey Street, you'll see blood marks on the pavement!  
You'll also see something stagger down Lindsey Street to the north.  
Follow after the shadow.  If you try to wander off somewhere else the 
game will push you back.

Along the right side of the street you'll find HEALTH DRINKS.  They're 
small medicine bottles and kind of hard to see, so start training your 
eyes to pick them out. On the left side of the road, there is also the 
SWAMP MONUMENT, which you can read to learn about Blood Swamp which once 
was here before the land was settled.  You won't be able to read much 
though because the plaque is scratched up and dirty.

When you arrive at Vachss Road, you'll see more bloodstains curving down 
that road.  You have to go this way because Katz Street is blocked by a 
barricade and Nathan Avenue is blocked by a cave in.  You may notice a 
fenced-in area on the right shortly after starting down the road.  If 
you walk through the gate, you'll find a SAVE POINT, and two HEALTH 
DRINKS.

After visiting this area, continue down Vachss Road.  You'll come to a 
construction zone.  At the very end of the road, you'll start to hear 
some strange noise.  Go through the barricade blocking the tunnel, and 
James will discover it's a broken RADIO.  Suddenly, he's attacked by a 
monster like the one he saw going down Lindsey Street.  He quickly grabs 
a PLANK to defend himself with.

It looks like a zombie kind of. Hit it several times with the PLANK 
until it dies. James will mutter to himself, wondering what the heck he 
just killed. Go through the barricade again.  James will examine the 
RADIO again, but he can't make it work.  James decides to hang onto it 
anyway.  You'll use it to detect monsters, so don't turn it off.

Run back down Vachss Road again.  Once you get back into the city, 
you'll discover it's been overrun by zombies like the one you saw at the 
construction site just now.  They're kind of slow, so you can evade them 
with relative ease in the wide open streets.  You ought to do that, 
because there's way too many of them to kill.

Now, we're going to go out and explore the town some.  Go west on Katz 
Street, then turn north onto Martin Street.  You can find a HEALTH DRINK 
a little past the green car here.  At the very end of this road, you'll 
find a corpse.  Search it to get the APARTMENT GATE KEY.

Now, if you want to, you can go straight to the next part of the game, 
which is at the Wood Side Apartment Building.  Or, you can go out and 
search the town for more supplies first.  If you're new to this game, 
then by all means, hunt around town for more items before going to the 
apartment building.  I'll list where the rest of items and some 
noteworthy locations are below for you:

- NEELY'S BAR on Neely Street.  A camera will focus on the entrance door 
when you pass by it.  Inside it you'll find a map indicating where most 
the blocked up streets and where some other places to visit are.  You'll 
also be able to read a strange message written on a window:  "There was 
a HOLE here. It's gone now."

- The TRAILER on the west end of Saul Street.  There's a note inside 
telling you about NEELY'S BAR above, and a SAVE POINT.

- at the Happy Burger at the corner of Sanders and Neely, you can find a 
FIRST-AID KIT.

- at the Lucky Jade Restaurant at the corner of Katz and Neely, you can 
find a FIRST-AID KIT and HANDGUN BULLETS.

When you're ready to move on, go to the Wood Side Apartment Building on 
the west end of Katz Street.  Unlock the front gate near the road block 
here with the APARTMENT GATE KEY.

=======================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WOOD SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================

FRONT LOT
Go through the door near you on the west side.  You won't find anything 
useful out here.  Be sure to note the garbage chute down the alley to 
the right of the entrance though, because you'll be coming back here 
later.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Immediately after entering, take the MAP OF THE APT BLDG from the 
bulletin board on your left.  You WILL need it to get through this part.  
You can't read it well in here, because all the lights are off and some 
idiot boarded up all the windows.  Be sure to locate the FLASHLIGHT as 
soon as possible.

You can also find a HEALTH DRINK on the planter in front of you, and a 
SAVE POINT on the right wall.  Go upstairs and take the door leading 
into the second floor.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
In here, you'll get attacked by more zombies, but this time you're in 
narrow corridors.  If you are playing hard mode, I suggest you just run 
like the wind past all the monsters.  In hard mode the monsters just 
won't die and by the time you've killed some of them, you'll have a lot 
of damage.

Immediately after entering, go into the small laundry room to the right 
of the room you're in now.  Look in the garbage chute and you'll see 
some trash stuck in the hole.  Be sure to remember this area.  Go east 
down the hall and go into ROOM 205.

ROOM 205
Note the mannequinn.  You can see a bright light streaming out from its 
front.  If you go closer you can see a FLASHLIGHT is being held up by 
it.  When you take it from the mannequinn, you'll be attacked by a new 
monster.  I call them the legs.  Run back outta there.  You can easily 
get out the door before it can reach you.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to Room 210.

ROOM 210
You can find some HANDGUN BULLETS in one of the bedrooms, and one on the 
coffee table in the living room.  Leave when you're done.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
You've searched all the rooms on this floor that will offer something 
for now.  All the rest are either blocked up, locked up, or you can't do 
anything in them yet because you don't have the needed items.  Go back 
to the door to the SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Go upstairs to the third floor door.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Just to your right is a set of bars, and a key is behind them.  If you 
check the bars, James thinks that he just might be able to reach it.  
When James tries to reach out and get the key, a little girl kicks it 
away then stomps on his hand.  She then runs off saying "Ha-ha!"  Stupid 
James, he could have easily gotten the key if he used that PLANK to drag 
it over.

Anyway, the key is too far away to reach now.  Go west down the hall to 
ROOM 301.

ROOM 301
In here you'll see that the room's been shot up like somebody came in 
here with an assault rifle and just blasted everything.  Anyway, search 
the shopping cart in the middle of the room to find a HANDGUN.  I am 
thinking the same thing as James when he examines the cart.  Why DOES 
somebody keep a shopping cart in their room?  Go back out into the hall.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go back into the SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Go downstairs to the second floor door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Notice that all the monsters have vanished.  Go east down the hall.  
When you come to the first hall intersection, you'll hear somebody 
scream from the north.  Go down the hall here to the north.  Whoa, 
what's that scary thing behind the bars?  You can't shoot it or kill it, 
so don't try.  It won't do anything to you anyway.  Enter ROOM 208.

ROOM 208
Walk around the corner, and you'll find a corpse sitting in front of the 
turned-on TV set.  Who killed him, and why?  Anyway, search the shelf to 
the left of the corpse to find the KEY TO ROOM 202 on the shelves.  
Before going, note the grandfather clock in the bedroom.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Uh oh, that guy behind the bars is gone.  Is he on the prowl for us now?  
What's worse, the hall that was previously empty is now filled with 
monsters again.  Go to ROOM 202 and unlock it with the KEY TO ROOM 202, 
duh.

ROOM 202
I like to call this room the Butterfly Room, because the guy who lived 
here must have been nuts about butterflies.  His pets are flying all 
over the place, but don't worry, they won't hurt you or anything.  Go 
into the bedroom and examine the hole in the wall.  You'll see something 
inside it.  After a brief scare James will take out the CLOCK KEY.  You 
ought to know where to go now that you've got it.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go back to ROOM 208.

ROOM 208
If you look at the stand in the living room, you'll read a strange poem.  
It talks about three needles, and this guy called Scott who "rests not 
on three, but fifteen."  Hmm...

While you ponder this, go into the room with the grandfather clock, and 
examine the markings on the wall across from the clock.  You'll read the 
names Henry, Mildred, and Scott.  Also, each one of them has an arrow 
next to them.  The next thing you should do is unlock the clock.

Note that the second hand is pointing at fifteen, or three.  That's it!   
Each of those names you read represents a hand, and the arrow is the 
direction you point them in.  Henry is the hour hand, Mildred is minute 
hand, and Scott is the second hand.  What you have to do is put the 
hands in the same places as the markings.

When the hands are in thier correct places and stopped, you'll hear a 
click. Examine the side of the clock and you will be asked if you want 
to push it.  Do so, and a hole in the wall behind the clock will give 
you access to ROOM 209.

ROOM 209
In the kitchen of this room, you'll find a HEALTH DRINK, and there will 
be a SAVE POINT on top of a tea cart.  Leave the room via the front 
door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go into the stairwell to the north.

NORTH STAIRWELL
Go upstars.  The first floor door is locked.  At the third floor 
landing, you'll find a box of HANDGUN BULLETS on the stair rail.  Go 
into the THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go into ROOM 307 to the south of where you are.

ROOM 307
When James enters the room, he'll see the monster that you saw behind 
the bars on the second floor.  From now on we'll call him Pyramid Head, 
because of his large, conical helmet.  Pyramid Head is currently busy 
taking out his rage on some legs.

James gets scared and hides in a closet.  After Pyramid Head kills the 
legs, he slowly walks towards the closet.  James finds a clip inside the 
closet and blasts away at Pyramid Head before he retreats through the 
front door.

After Pyramid Head leaves, take the COURTYARD KEY that's in the closet 
you were hiding in.  Go out into the hall again.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to ROOM 303.

ROOM 303
Here, you will find a FIRST-AID KIT in the living room, a HEALTH DRINK 
in the kitchen, and HANDGUN BULLETS in one of the bedrooms.  After 
you've gathered these things up, leave.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Get the FIRE ESCAPE KEY in front of the bars where it was kicked away 
from you by that girl, then go to the east end of the hall and into the 
SOUTHEAST STAIRWELL.

SOUTHEAST STAIRWELL
Go down to the first floor.  Go to the end of the first floor corridor 
here to find the CANNED JUICE.  You can't use it as a health item, so 
what can you do with it?  Don't worry, one of the rules of every 
survival horror game is that no matter how strange the object, it will 
always eventually serve some kind of purpose.  Unlock and go out through 
the front door on the first floor.

FRONT LOT
Run to the front door to the west.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Head up to the second floor door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go into the laundry room to the right, and dump the CANNED JUICE in the 
trash chute to cause the "strange garbage" to get unstuck and fall down 
to the bottom.  Go back to the SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL again.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Head downstairs and go out the front door.

FRONT LOT
Go to the garbage chute around the corner.  In the bag of trash, you'll 
find the OLD MAN COIN, and you'll also get to read a GOSSIP MAGAZINE.  
It talks of a man called Walter Sullivan, who murdered two children 
called Billy Locane and his sister Miriam.

It says he committed suicide in his jail cell.  A schoolmate of his said 
that he was blurting out crazy stuff about a red devil right before he 
was arrested, and admits he was kind of crazy.  Be sure to keep Walter's 
name in mind for later.  Go back into the SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Use the COURTYARD KEY on the door on the first floor.

COURTYARD
Go up onto the pool deck.  Jump down into the empty pool here and you'll 
see a baby carriage.  Search it to find the SNAKE COIN.  Take the 
eastern door here back into the building.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go into ROOM 101 to the south.

ROOM 101
In the kitchen, you'll find a dead body stuffed into the refrigerator, 
and you can also hear somebody puking in the next room.  Get the HANDGUN 
BULLETS in the living room, then open the door next to the kitchen.

Inside you'll find Eddie, who is puking his guts out into the toilet.  
Eddie denies that he didn't kill anybody before James even says 
anything.  Eddie asks him about the dead guy in the kitchen, and he says 
he didn't kill anyone.  He says he hid in here from the monsters he saw 
outside.

James says that this place isn't very safe either, and that he ought to 
be getting out.  Eddie says he doesn't know what is going on here, and 
that he was brought here by something, like James was.  They both tell 
each other to be careful, then James leaves.  Leave the room.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to ROOM 104.

ROOM 104
In here you can find HANDGUN BULLETS in the living room.  After getting 
them, leave.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Head out through the door into the COURTYARD again.

COURTYARD
Take the southern door.

SOUTHWEST STAIRWELL
Head up to the second floor door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the west end of the hall and use your FIRE ESCAPE KEY here.  
You'll discover that there's no fire escape because another apartment 
building was put up here where it used to be.  Looks like you'll have to 
go through another stinkin' building before you'll be allowed to get out 
of this place. Don't worry, you won't be there near as long as you were 
in this building. Go across the gap into the Blue Creek Apartment 
building.

=======================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLUE CREEK APARTMENT BUILDING
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================

ROOM 203
Go to the bathroom across from the bedroom you're in.  CVXFREAK missed 
it the first time, but me, Minesweeper, and AndyRose2000 both found a 
wallet in the toilet with a safe combination.  Eew, toilet water.

The wallet will give you some numbers and arrows.  The number is the 
safe number, and the arrow points in the direction that the dial must be 
turned in to reach the number.  On hard mode you'll get Roman numerals 
instead of regular digits.  Remember, X equals ten, and V equals five.  
If you get the number X0 for example, that means 10.  Or if you get VV4, 
that means 14.

You will receive four boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS for opening the safe. I, 
Minesweeper, found this myself, though I'll still thank to AndyRose2000 
for this hint.  Before going out, find the HEALTH DRINK in the kitchen.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
On this second floor, the only room you should concern yourself with is 
ROOM 209.  It has a note on it which tells where to find the key to 
unlock the door.  The key's in a room near the first floor staircase.  
Read the note if you want to, then go to the middle part of the hallway 
where the MIDDLE STAIRWELL door is marked by the red EXIT sign.

MIDDLE STAIRWELL
Look to your left on the floor to find the MAP OF THE WESP APT BLDG.  
Head down to the first floor door, as the third floor is blocked off.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Be sure to look in the laundry room to the right of the MIDDLE STAIRWELL 
to find a FIRST-AID KIT.  Go to ROOM 109.

[NOTE:  If you haven't talked to Eddie in the Woodside Apartment 
building, then you won't be able to get into ROOM 109 right now.  Go 
back and talk to Eddie in the Woodside Apartment building in ROOM 101 
now if you haven't already.]

ROOM 109
You can get some HANDGUN BULLETS on the sofa here.  Take the white door.  
In here you'll run into Angela.  It looks like she's about to commit 
suicide with the knife she has, but James talks her out of it.  She says 
she hasn't found her mother yet.  James also says that he hasn't found 
his wife, and she shows her her picture.  She says she hasn't seen her.

She begins to leave, and James asks if he should go with her.  She says 
she doesn't really need anybody with her.  James asks if she should get 
rid of that knife.  She agrees that she doesn't know what she could do 
with it, and says she'll give it to him.  When James moves to take it, 
she suddenly screams and holds the knife in front of her.  She then 
quickly apologizes and lays the knife on the stand, then runs out the 
door.

You'll get ANGELA'S KNIFE, which can't be used as a weapon, and if you 
search the stand again, you'll get the PRISONER COIN.  Leave the room.

[NOTE: Rumor has it that examining the Knife may affect the game's
ending. I can guess that if you examine the Knife in the item screen, a
new ending occurs. I will have to try this out.]

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to ROOM 105.

ROOM 105
Examine the cabinet with the five little holes in it.  It looks like 
that guy's kooky uncle mentioned in the note put their keys in a fancy 
puzzle-locked drawer.  I'd beat my uncle down if I had to solve this 
stupid puzzle to get into my apartment.

This is where you have to use all those coins you've found around the 
apartment buildings.  Read the poem that you get, and use the clues you 
read to figure out where the coins belong.  If you can't figure it out, 
the solutions are below.  When I say the second, third, etc. slot, I 
mean it from left to right, like this:

1 2 3 4 5

HARD Mode - OLD MAN COIN - second slot
          - SNAKE COIN - fourth slot
          - PRISONER COIN - fifth slot

NORMAL Mode - OLD MAN COIN - second slot
            - PRISONER COIN - third slot
            - SNAKE COIN - fifth slot

EASY Mode - OLD MAN COIN - first slot
          - SNAKE COIN - third slot
          - PRISONER COIN - fifth slot

Once the coins are in their proper places, the drawer will open, and 
you'll be able to get the LYNE HOUSE KEY.  This is the key that was 
mentioned in the note tacked to the door to ROOM 209, so you should go 
there.  If you want to, you can use the SAVE POINT in here in the hall.  
Leave the room.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Head for the MIDDLE STAIRWELL.

MIDDLE STAIRWELL
Go to the second floor door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to ROOM 209 and unlock it with the LYNE HOUSE KEY.

ROOM 209/ROOM 208
Walk to the window in the living room, and unlike all the other windows 
in these apartments, this one's open and not boarded up.  Walk out onto 
the balcony, then walk through the smashed partiton to get onto ROOM 
208's balcony.

Go into that apartment and get the HANDGUN BULLETS from the chair, and 
the APARTMENT STAIRWAY KEY from the top of the bed.  There's also a SAVE 
POINT in here.  Things are going to get pretty tough in a minute, so I 
strongly suggest you save here.  Exit through ROOM 209's front door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the stairwell to the north and unlock it with the APARTMENT 
STAIRWAY KEY.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM

When you enter the room, you'll see Pyramid Head taking out his rage on  
a zombie.  James witnesses this and tries to flee, but the door locked 
behind him, so you'll have to fight.

Watch out for the GREAT KNIFE Pyramid has.  One overhead swing is enough 
to kill you, no matter how good your health is.  My favorite way to beat 
him is to stand near the door, then when Pyramid Head gets close and 
begins the overhead swing animation, I run to the corner diagonally 
across from the door, and repeat run past again during the overhead 
swing animation.  I keep repeating this while firing bullets until 
Pyramid Head goes away.  You'll know if you're hurting him when you hear 
a shot clank off of his helmet.

If you want to fight him with the PLANK instead, you can wait for him to 
do the motion that he's about to do an overhead swing, then run behind 
him and hit him in the back with the PLANK.  He won't stop in the middle 
of the swinging animation, so you'll be safe.  This is a lot trickier 
than doing it with the HANDGUN.

You'll know you've defeated Pyramid Head when you hear sirens in the 
distance.  When the sirens come on, Pyramid Head will walk down the 
stairs and into the water.  Get out of his way and he won't attack you.  
Also don't follow after him down the stairs or you might get killed.

Another away to defeat him, thanks to someone e-mailing CVXFREAK, is to 
evade Pyramid Head until you hear the sirens and he goes down the 
stairs.  Hurting him will make him go down the stairs sooner, though.  I 
recommend you evade him if you want to save your precious ammo.
======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Pyramid Head goes down the stairs, the water will drain away and 
you can go down the stairs.  Leave out the door you see down here.  
Finally we're out of those stupid apartment buildings!

=======================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WESTERN SILENT HILL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================

WESTERN SILENT HILL
Welcome to the western district.  Remember that your main objective once 
you got into town was to go to Rosewater Park so you can see if you 
could find Mary there.  Now that we have escaped EASTERN SILENT HILL, we 
can go there.  Walk down the stairs, and get the FIRST-AID KIT from the 
barricade to the left.

Go down the alleyway to the north.  On the way, you'll run into the kid 
that stepped on your hand and kicked the key away in the Wood Side 
Apartment Building.  She's sitting on top of a wall.  James asks her 
about that letter she's holding, and she says it's none of his business, 
and yells he didn't like Mary anyway.  James tells her to wait, asking 
how she knew Mary, but she jumps down on the other side of the wall and 
runs away.

Continue on through the tunnel, and you'll arrive in Rosewater Park, the 
one that James talked about near the beginning of the game.  If you 
search the confusing courtyard to the west, you'll find two boxes of 
HANDGUN BULLETS in a corner, and a HEALTH DRINK on a park bench.  You 
can also find another box of HANDGUN BULLETS on a bench near the small 
pavilion.  When you reach the waterfront, you can find a HEALTH DRINK 
near a telescope.

On the way down the waterfront, you'll run into a woman.  James thinks 
it's Mary at first, but it turns out she's just a woman who looks like 
her named Maria.  The only things that are different are her hair and 
clothes.

Maria asks him about Mary, and he says he's here because she said this 
was their special place.  Maria says she hasn't seen her, and asks if 
there could be another special place somewhere.  James thinks a little, 
and says it might be the Lakeview Hotel they stayed at.  Maria says that 
she wants to tag along with James, because of the monsters, and he 
agrees to it.

She'll follow you around now.  I smell another Sherry Birkin scenario 
here...  If she gets killed, it's GAME OVER.  She'll get in the way 
while you're attacking monsters.  You can hurt her with your weapons, so 
you have to be careful not to accidentally hit her.  Unlike Sherry, 
however, she can run just as fast as you.  No matter how hard you run, 
she'll be able to keep up.

Exit Rosewater Park via the west entrance.  Don't bother to search the 
second courtyard, because you won't find anything, except a 
suspicious-looking patch of dirt behind a statue.  You can't do anything 
to it though.  On the path leading out, you'll find a HEALTH DRINK on 
the right side of the path, near a building's entrance.

Now that you're out of the park, you can either go straight to Pete's 
Bowl-O-Rama to start the next part of the game, or check out WESTERN 
SILENT HILL for more supplies.  I'll list places where you can find 
items:

- at the Jack's Inn motel at the corner of Murron and Nathan, you can 
find a SAVE POINT on the trunk of a blue car.

- on the west side of the blocked up alley you entered from the Blue 
Creek Apartment Building, you can find a HEALTH DRINK.

- near the west end of Katz street is a FIRST-AID KIT in front of a tan 
car. You can also find another FIRST-AID KIT in a garbage pen across the 
street.

- at the Texxon Gas Station at the corner of Carroll and Nathan, you can 
find the STEEL PIPE, a new weapon, stuck in a car's hood, a HEALTH DRINK 
and a box of HANDGUN BULLETS in front of a garage door, and two more 
HEALTH DRINKS and HANDGUN BULLETS in front of a parked van.

After you've gathered up all your supplies, go to Pete's Bowl-O-Rama at 
the corner of Nathan and Carroll.  Maria says she'll wait outside 
because she hates bowling.  James says he's not going to be playing a 
game, but she still wants to stay outside anyway.

[NOTE:  If you try to go to the Lakeview Hotel by going west down Nathan 
Avenue, you'll get stopped by a destroyed bridge.  A corpse will by 
lying in the roadway with a map nearby, which will direct you back 
towards Pete's Bowl-O-Rama.  I told you to go to the bowling alley above 
so you won't have to take a long walk.  The only reward for coming this 
way is a box of HANDGUN BULLETS near the corpse.]

PETE'S BOWL-O-RAMA
Take the door to the left of the one you used to get in.  You'll view a 
conversation between Eddie and Laura, the little girl who's been 
pestering you recently.  Laura talks with Eddie about what he did that 
made the cops come after him, while he chows down on some pizza.  Wonder 
where he got it, considering most everyone in this town is either dead 
or vanished.

Whatever he did do, Eddie says nobody will ever forgive him for it.  
While you're looking around in the staff room, he asks if she's found 
Mary yet.  Mary...!  Go to the door on the other end of the staff room 
and walk out of the snack bar to talk to Eddie.

While James asks if he's here alone, Laura runs out the front door and 
says "Bye-bye!"  James yells at Eddie to come with him to get her, but 
he asks why he should.  He says she called him a stupid fatso who would 
slow her down.  James gets angry at him because the town's full of 
monsters and all he cares about is eating pizza.  He then storms away 
angry.

If you want to, you can check at the end of the third alley from the 
right to find HANDGUN BULLETS.  Go out the front door after Laura.

WESTERN SILENT HILL
When you come outside, Maria will run up to you, out of breath.  James 
asks if she saw the girl, and she says that she tried to catch her, but 
the girl was too fast.  Turn right from the door and run around behind 
the bowling alley.  You'll find an open gate.  Go through it.

Turn left and walk to the end of the alley.  Maria will tell you that 
Laura went between the buildings.  The space is too narrow for an adult.  
James asks if there's another way, and Maria points to a nearby door.  
The door's locked, she unlocks the door with three keys and gestures you 
inside.

HEAVEN'S NIGHT
Go up the stairs and down the hall.  Go through the door in the end.  
You'll emerge into a strip club called Heaven's Night.  It seems pretty 
fitting that Maria would have the keys to a place like this, with her 
attitude and the way she dresses.  Take the FIRST-AID KIT from a chair 
of the table closest to the front door, then leave through the front 
door.

WESTERN SILENT HILL
Go down the street, and you'll see Laura run inside the hospital.  
Follow after her.

=======================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BROOKHAVEN HOSPITAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Grr...I absolutely HATE this part of the game, because it's so long and 
boring.  Of all the places Laura could have run to, why did it have to 
be a confusing rat-maze of a hospital!?  You'll also need to be careful 
in here because Maria is behind you.  Remember, if she get's killed, 
it's GAME OVER.

You got a lot of exploring to do, so get started by taking the MAP OF 
THE HOSPITAL from the bulletin board to your left.  The first place you 
should go is the RECEPTION OFFICE, which is the door nearby the 
reception window.

RECEPTION OFFICE
In here you'll find a SAVE POINT.  Proceed onto the next door.

DOCUMENT ROOM
Examine the document.  It talks of an illness which drags it's victim 
into "the other side," which is a place between reality and unreality.  
At the bottom of the document is a handwritten note, which says that a 
guy got the key from Joseph, and it's probably for "that box."  You'll 
receive the "PURPLE BULL" KEY, which is the key mentioned in the 
document.  Leave the room again.

RECEPTION OFFICE
Go out into the hallway.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the stairway.

EAST STAIRWAY
Go up to the second floor door.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Watch out for the nurses of death stalking the halls.  Those long clubs 
they have are deadly.  One nurse is bad enough, but unless you find some 
hard hitting firepower, you'll die if there's a pair after you at the 
same time.  The first place you ought to go to is the WOMEN'S LOCKER 
ROOM to the north.

WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM
Inside this room, you'll find the much-needed SHOTGUN in a locker.  
Examine the teddy bear to the left of that locker and James will 
accidentally prick his hand.  He finds that he stuck his finger on a 
BENT NEEDLE and takes it.  Leave the room.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM nearby.

MEN'S LOCKER ROOM
Search the dirty lab coat hanging from a locker on the right to find the 
EXAMINATION ROOM KEY.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go back to the stairs.

EAST STAIRWAY
Go back to the first floor.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR

Unlock the EXAMINATION ROOM with the EXAMINATION ROOM KEY, duh.

EXAMINATION ROOM
Go through this room into the DOCTOR'S LOUNGE.

DOCTOR'S LOUNGE
Look in the sink to find SHOTGUN SHELLS, which you'll probably have a 
desperate need for in this place with those maniac nurses running 
around.  Look at the whiteboard on the east wall.

In EASY and NORMAL the game gives you 7335, the code for the door to the 
patient wing.  On HARD you get this cryptic message about the number 
being T.  I don't understand how it works, but from this clue you're 
supposed to get 1328 as the code.  Leave through the door you didn't use 
to get in.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the stairs again.

EAST STAIRWAY
Go upstairs to the second floor.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Take the double doors near you which lead into the corridor with the M 
rooms.

M CORRIDOR
Go into EXAMINING ROOM 3.

EXAMINING ROOM 3
You'll find a FIRST-AID KIT on the bed here.  Examine the typewriter on 
the northern wall.  In a message that has the same kind of grammar and 
punctuation as most emails I receive about my FAQ's, you'll get a random 
code for a box. (I got 7998 and 1151 once) Be sure to remember it 
because you'll need to know it later.  Leave the room.

M CORRIDOR
Go into M2.

M2
Look at the stand on the eastern wall to get the "LAPIS EYE" KEY and a 
box of SHOTGUN SHELLS.

M CORRIDOR
Go into M3.

M3
In here you'll find a box of HANDGUN BULLETS and a HEALTH DRINK in front 
of the overturned beds.

M CORRIDOR
There's one more room in this corridor you can visit, but it's risky to 
go in there, especially on HARD mode.

M6
In here, two nurses will attack you and Maria simultaneously on HARD.  
You both will probably suffer a lot of damage here.  You will get for a 
reward a HEALTH DRINK and a box of HANDGUN BULLETS.

M CORRIDOR
Go to the SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR.

SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the stairs.

EAST STAIRWAY
Go up to the third floor.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
If you're willing to brave the nurses, you can find a FIRST-AID KIT in 
the open area near the elevator.  Go to the double doors near the 
stairs.  Input 7335 as the code if you're playing EASY or NORMAL, or 
1328 if you're playing HARD.  Go through the door.

S CORRIDOR
Go to S3.

S3
Maria will say she's feeling tired and takes some medicine.  She says 
it's a hangover, and James suggests she sleeps on the bed in here.  He 
says he's going to go look for Laura while she rests.  Take the ROOF KEY 
here, then leave the room.

S CORRIDOR
At long last, Maria is gone and we don't have to worry about protecting 
her from the monsters or accidentally hitting her!  Go back into the 
THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Head for the stairs.

EAST STAIRWAY
Go up to the roof and unlock the door there with the ROOF KEY.

ROOF
Your health had better be filled up pretty high when you come out here.   
You'll find a diary up here.  You can read it if you want to.

[NOTE: It's rumored that if you read the diary, you get a certain 
ending. CVXFREAK hasn't confirmed this, but it seems likely.]

Walk towards the ELEVATOR CONTROL ROOM, and you'll hear a grinding noise 
behind you.  What is that?  Suddenly, Pyramid Head will appear and knock 
you off the roof with his GREAT KNIFE.

SPECIAL TREATMENT ROOM
You'll discover that you fell through the roof of the third floor and 
have ended up in this area.  You should have been hurt pretty badly by 
the fall, so heal up now.  Take the second door from the left in here.

PADDED CELL 2
You'll see a message written on the wall in blood.  It's a wierd 
message, but you'll get another code.  It's random, so be sure to 
remember it.  Leave the room.

SPECIAL TREATMENT ROOM
Leave out the entrance.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the S CORRIDOR.

S CORRIDOR
Go to S11.

S11
In here, you'll find a SAVE POINT and a HEALTH DRINK.  Save if you want 
to, and leave.

S CORRIDOR
Go to S14.

S14
In here, you'll find the box that you may remember being mentioned in 
the files you've found since entering the hospital.  It's locked up 
pretty tight, but don't worry, because you should have all the codes and 
keys necessary to unlock it.

Use the "PURPLE BULL" KEY and the "LAPIS EYE" KEY to remove two of the 
locks.  Use the code you got from the typewriter in EXAMINING ROOM 3 on 
the second floor on the number pad, and use the code you got from the 
SPECIAL TREATMENT ROOM on the this floor to undo the combination lock.

For all your trouble, you'll get HAIR!!!  Umm...HAIR???  What are we 
supposed to do with that?!  Don't worry, ALL items in a survival horror 
game, no matter how obscure, will always eventually serve a purpose.  
Leave the room.

S CORRIDOR
Go to the SHOWER ROOM.

SHOWER ROOM
Look at the drain pipe in the middle of the room with the green slime.  
James will suggest finding a long, narrow tool to get the thing at the 
bottom of the pipe.  The "long, narrow tool" you'll use is the HAIR 
combined with the BENT NEEDLE.

Use the "Combine" command on both the HAIR and the BENT NEEDLE, then 
click "Use."  James will lower the BENT NEEDLE into the pipe like a 
fishing hook, and his catch of the day is the ELEVATOR KEY.  Leave the 
room.

S CORRIDOR
You might want to go to S11 to save before you proceed onward.  Go to 
the elevator, and use the ELEVATOR KEY to open the cover over the call 
button.  Hop inside the elevator and ride down to the first floor.

C CORRIDOR
Go to C3.

C3
Search in front of the matress to the left to find HANDGUN BULLETS, and 
look on the stand to the right to find SHOTGUN SHELLS.  Leave.

C CORRIDOR
Go to C2.

C2
Walk over to the teddy bears in front of you, and you'll see Laura 
playing with them.  James asks her about Mary, and she says she was 
friends with her while she was sick.  James says that's impossible, and 
he says they should talk about this later while they get out.

C CORRIDOR
Laura says she needs to get something, and says it's a letter from Mary.  
She unlocks a door and gestures you inside.

EXAMINING ROOM 2
James begins to go inside, and Laura says it's at the back of the room.  
As James moves for the back of the room, Laura slams the door and locks 
him inside.  I don't know about you, but I saw this coming a mile away, 
unlike stupid ole James.  He frantically yells at Laura to open the 
door, but she decides not to.  Meanwhile, some monsters swing down from 
the ceiling.  Looks like you'll have to fight your way out...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
=====================
BOSS # 2: HANGING MEN
=====================
DIFFICULTY: Easy

This fight's pretty easy, especially compared to the fight with Pyramid 
Head back at the Blue Creek Apartment Building.  Just blast them with 
the SHOTGUN or the HANDGUN.  If you let them get close, they'll choke 
you with their feet, but it won't cause a lot of damage.  Keep track of 
your health and everything will be fine.

After you defeat three of them, the battle will end, and you'll hear 
those sirens again as James goes unconsious.  You'll get a scene of 
James being carted out of the hospital and into the GARDEN on a hospital 
bed.

GARDEN
We have now entered Dark Silent Hill from Misty Silent Hill.  In case 
you don't know, Dark Silent Hill is the even darker side of this strange 
town which is already bad enough in its normal form.  Anyway, this is 
some garden you're standing in.  It's just a small square of grass 
surrounded by concrete walls.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams Players:

If you have the BLUE GEM, use it right now if you have it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leave out through the double doors.

WESTERN FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
In here, you'll find a SAVE POINT on a chain link fence, and a box of 
SHOTGUN SHELLS.  Move on to the C CORRIDOR.

C CORRIDOR
Go to C2.

C2
In here, you'll find a FIRST-AID KIT.  Ignore the sound of breaking 
glass, because it's only there to scare you.  BTW, what's up with all 
the sheets covering everything?  Leave the room.

C CORRIDOR
Go to C1.

C1
In here, you'll find a HEALTH DRINK and HANDGUN BULLETS.  Leave.

C CORRIDOR
Go into the elevator, and ride it to the second floor.

M CORRIDOR
Go to M6.

M6
Inside M6, you'll find HANDGUN BULLETS, a FIRST-AID KIT, and in the wall 
painting, you'll find the DRY CELL BATTERY and the BASEMENT STOREROOM 
KEY.  It would be good to have an extra battery, you know, in case your 
flashlight battery ran out.  Read the note to the right of the painting.  
The guy who wrote it said he lost a ring in the basement's basement.  
Basement's basement?  What is he talking about?  Keep that note in mind 
and leave the room.

M CORRIDOR
Go to M4.

M4
You will find SHOTGUN SHELLS and a HEALTH DRINK in here.  Leave.

M CORRIDOR
If you want to, look in the DAY ROOM.

DAY ROOM
On the floor is a refrigerator, but the door is too heavy for James to 
open it alone.  Just keep this place in mind for later.

M CORRIDOR
Go to the elevator, and head to the third floor.

S CORRIDOR
Notice the odd door next to you, with the woman painting on it, and a 3D 
hand sticking out, maybe to put a ring on it?  Again keep this location 
in mind.  Go to S11.

S11
Get the HANDGUN BULLETS and the AMPOULE in here.  Leave.

S CORRIDOR
Go to S3.

S3
Maria's gone...  All that's left of her is several empty medicine 
bottles.  Leave the room again.  We'll have to find her.

S CORRIDOR
Go to the THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the THIRD FLOOR STOREROOM.

THIRD FLOOR STOREROOM
On the shelves in here, you'll find a FIRST-AID KIT, HANDGUN BULLETS, 
and SHOTGUN SHELLS.  Leave.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the stairs.

EAST STAIRCASE
You'll find a SAVE POINT in here if you need to save. Walk all the way 
down to the basement level and unlock the door there with the BASEMENT 
STOREROOM KEY.  All the other doors are locked anyway.

BASEMENT STOREROOM
Get the SHOTGUN SHELLS off the floor, and note the shelf with the bloody 
handprints.  Move the shelf out of the way to reveal a secret ladder.  
When you examine it, Maria will appear.

She's angry because you left her behind and you don't sound happy to see 
her.  James apologizes for his actions and says he found Laura, but she 
ran off.  Maria says she feels like she has to protect her.  After you 
are done talking, go down the ladder you revealed.

BASEMENT'S BASEMENT
So this is what that file meant upstairs about the basement's basement.  
Get the COPPER RING, and climb back out again.

BASEMENT STOREROOM
Go out the door.

EAST STAIRWELL
Run back up to the third floor and save your game.  Go into the hall.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go into the S CORRIDOR.

S CORRIDOR
Head for the elevator.  Take it down to the second floor.  Suddenly, a 
game show comes on over the radio, and you're the contestant!  What in 
the world is going on?!  The host says you must answer three questions.

Question #1:
What is the name of the amusement park in northern Silent Hill?
1 - Fantasy Land
2 - Silent Hill Amusement Park
3 - Lake Side Amusement Park

Question #2:
What is the name of the man who murdered two children?
1 - Walter Sullivan
2 - Scott Fairbanks
3 - Eric Gein

Question #3:
What is the name of the road leading to Paleville?
1 - Bachman Road
2 - Menden Street
3 - Nathan Avenue

The host then says to answer the questions, you should go to the 
storeroom on the third floor, and says you had better make sure you're 
not wrong, or you'll face the punishment.  Maria asks what that was 
about, and then the elevator arrives at the second floor.

M CORRIDOR
For now, let's ignore that crazy guy on the radio and go to the DAY 
ROOM.

DAY ROOM
Try to open the refrigerator again, and James still can't open it.  
Maria says she'll help.  With both of you working together, you'll open 
it up.  Get the LEAD RING from inside, then go back into the M CORRIDOR.

M CORRIDOR
Go to the elevator and head up to the third floor again.

S CORRIDOR
Here, you have two choices.  You can either take the Trick or Treat 
challenge in the THIRD FLOOR STOREROOM, or unlock the strange door with 
the rings you found.  If you're going to skip over the Trick or Treat 
box, then skip everything past this row of stars, and I'll join you 
again at the next row of stars.  I'll warn you though, you're missing 
out on a huge item cache!

***********************************************************************

S CORRIDOR
Go into the THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go into the THIRD FLOOR STOREROOM.

THIRD FLOOR STOREROOM

You'll see that while you were gone, somebody put a new box there.  This 
is 
where you have to enter your answers. Here is the sequence box.

    1 2 3
Q1: O O O
Q2: O O O
Q3: O O O

On Row 1, the correct answer is button 3, because if you check your map 
you'd know that the name of the amusement park is Lakeside Amusement 
Park.

On Row 2, the correct answer is button 1, because if you looked in the 
gossip magazine you found in the garbage at the Wood Side Apartment 
Building, it would tell you the murderer is Walter Sullivan.

On Row 3, the correct answer is button 3, because again if you check 
your map, you would see the only road going to Paleville was Nathan 
Avenue.

If you press all the correct buttons, you'll receive five boxes of 
SHOTGUN SHELLS, and two AMPOULES.  This is well worth the little side 
trip.  If you're wrong, however, you get your health knocked down to 
near death if not dead, and the Trick or Treat Box locks up it's goodies 
permanently.  Leave the room.

THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the S CORRIDOR.

***********************************************************************

S CORRIDOR
Welcome back to the main track again.  Go to the door with the lady 
painting on it and put the LEAD RING and the COPPER RING on the 3D hand 
to unlock the door.

WEST STAIRWAY
Go down to the basement, as all the other doors are locked anyway.  On 
the way down, read the note with the same kind of poor spelling I get in 
emails about my FAQ's.  Behind the praying woman?  Maybe that odd patch 
of ground behind the praying woman statue in Rosemary Park?  Be sure to 
remember that.

LONG HALLWAY
Begin your trek down the hall.  Suddenly, Pyramid Head ambushes you from 
behind!  Run down the hall as fast as your legs can carry you, because 
again if Maria is killed, it's GAME OVER.

At the end of the hall, you'll get to an elevator.  James manages to get 
inside, but the doors close too far before Maria can get there in time.  
Only her hand manages to get through.  James watches, unable to do 
anything, as Pyramid Head kills Maria.

It's real sad, but her death is scripted.  You can't save her.  Her hand 
slips out of the door and the elevator goes to its destination.  James 
lowers to the floor in sadness.  You'll arrive at the first floor.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Go to the DIRECTOR'S ROOM.

DIRECTOR'S ROOM
Look at the map on the table.  You'll find a message directing you back 
to EASTERN SILENT HILL to find a letter and a WRENCH, plus circles 
around the western courtyard in Rosewater Park, and the SILENT HILL 
HISTORICAL SOCIETY.  James will copy the locations on to his map, and 
you'll get the HOSPITAL LOBBY KEY, which will let you out of the 
hospital's front door!  Finally we can get out of here!

As James picks up the key, he sees Laura through the window running  
down the street.  Leave the room.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR
Use the HOSPITAL LOBBY KEY to unlock the front door.  If you need to 
save, then use the SAVE POINT nearby.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DARK SILENT HILL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

WESTERN SILENT HILL
Dark Silent Hill's effects aren't as extreme this time, compared to 
Silent Hill 1.  The town simply goes into nighttime, without the streets 
turning into grating over bottomless pits.  Even better, there's a whole 
new set of items for you to pick up on the ground!

Go south down Carroll Street, then turn onto Rendell Street.  Go to the 
west end of Rendell, and you'll find a FIRST-AID KIT, a HEALTH DRINK, an 
AMPOULE, and HANDGUN BULLETS.

Walk east down Rendell.  If you walk on the left side of the street, 
you'll find lots of items on the way.  At one point along the road, 
you'll be able to walk behind some fencing into a lot.  In this lot, 
you'll find two boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS, two boxes of RIFLE SHELLS, and 
one box of HANDGUN BULLETS.  Near the point when you arrive at Monson, 
you'll find a HEALTH DRINK and SHOTGUN SHELLS on the left side of the 
road.

When you arrive at Monson Street, go south.  At the southern end of 
Monson Street, you will find two boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS.  On one of 
the corners of Saul and Monson, you'll find two HEALTH DRINKS.  Turn 
east onto Saul Street and head through the tunnel.  The monkeys under 
the fence can hurt you, but it's easy to avoid running over them.  
Unlock the gate at the end to reenter EASTERN SILENT HILL.

EASTERN SILENT HILL
If you want to, save in the trailer nearby.  New items have been 
scattered around here for you to take.  I'll list them for you.  I can't 
believe I actually took the time to write this thing:

- at the trailer, there's a FIRST-AID KIT.

- at the car a little ways away from the traier is two boxes of SHOTGUN 
SHELLS.

- in front of the diner east of the trailer, you'll find two boxes of 
HANDGUN BULLETS.

- at the Happy Burger, you'll find two boxes of RIFLE SHELS.

- on the back door steps of a warehouse at the corner of Sanders and 
Lindsey is two boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS, and around the corner on the 
front stairs is a HEALTH DRINK.

- at the Flower Shop, you'll find two boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS and one 
box of SHOTGUN SHELLS.

- on the front steps of the building around the corner of NEELY'S BAR, 
you'll get a HEALTH DRINK.

- at the corner of Neely and Sanders, you'll find HANDGUN BULLETS.

- at the Chiropractice and Sports Injury Center, at the western end of 
Sanders Street, you'll find a FIRST-AID KIT.

- at the corner of Saul and Neely, you'll find a FIRST-AID KIT.

- at Big Jay's, you'll find RIFLE SHELLS and a HEALTH DRINK.

- at the Grand Market, you can find HANDGUN BULLETS.

- in front of two businesses south of the Grand Market, you can get 
HEALTH DRINKS.

- at Cafe Texan, you'll find HANDGUN BULLETS.

- in front of a garage door just south of the entrance to Vachss Road, 
you'll get HANDGUN BULLETS.

- It's not really an item, but if you go inside NEELY'S BAR, where you 
found that map near the start of the game, you'll find a new and 
threatening message written on the wall in here, concerning James 
wanting to find Mary.

To continue on with the game, go to Gonzale's Mexican Restaurant.  On a 
house porch a door down is the letter and the WRENCH the map in the 
hospital showed you.  The letter directs you to go to the park near the 
statue of the praying woman, and use a wrench to open a box buried there 
to get the key to the Silent Hill Historical Society.  The note also 
harshy warns you of how terrible the path will be if you wish to 
continue on with your quest of finding Mary.

If you still want to keep going, despite the ominous warning, head west 
along Katz Street towards the Wood Side Apartment Building.  You may 
have noticed the door in the construction barricade there.  It was 
locked before, but you'll be able to get through it now into WESTERN 
SILENT HILL.

WESTERN SILENT HILL
If you STILL thirst for more items, you can find a handful more at these 
locations:

- on a staircase at the corner of Munson and Katz, you'll find HANDGUN 
BULLETS and a HEALTH DRINK.

- in the trash area at the west end of Katz Street, you'll find an 
AMPOULE.

- at the eastern end of Nathan Avenue, you'll get HANDGUN BULLETS.

- on the left side of the path going into Rosewater Park, you'll find 
two boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS.

After you are done looking around, enter Rosewater Park via the west 
enterance and go into the western courtyard.  Look for the praying woman 
statue, and dig up the patch of dirt behind it.  A box fastened with 
screws will be revealed.  Use the WRENCH to remove the screws and get 
the OLD BRONZE KEY.

This is the key to the Silent Hill Historical Society to the northwest.  
Walk west along Nathan Avenue there to get there.  Before heading 
inside, get the FIRST-AID KIT from in front of the gate blocking the 
boat launch.  Use the OLD BRONZE KEY to open the front door.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SILENT HILL HISTORICAL SOCIETY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

ENTRANCE ROOM/EXHIBIT ROOM 1
There's a SAVE POINT on the counter if you need to save.  Proceed 
through the doorway that has its doors torn off.  In here, observe the 
painting on the left wall.  It's called "Misty day, remains of the 
Judgement," and it displays Pyramid Head next to several of his victims.  
Why would a picture of him be here?  Anyway, proceed to the next room.

EXHIBIT ROOM 2/LONG STAIRWAY
In here, you can look at several paintings of Silent Hill's history.  
One of them displays an old photograph of Brookhaven Hospital, another 
of the director of the old Brookhaven Hospital, and a picture of a deep 
hole for some reason.  Go through the large hole in the wall and a 
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong way 
down the stairway.  Perhaps a way to build your anticipation of what's 
to come?  Eventually, you'll get to a door.  Go through it.

CHECKPOINT
Look at the document, and you might get a bit of a shock, because the 
most recent date is 1820.  Take the FIRST-AID KIT from the table, and 
move on to the next room.

MYSTERY CORRIDOR
Walk through the gates, and turn left.  The door to the right has it's 
lock broken.  At the next fork, turn right, the left leads to a dead 
end.  You might not notice it, but there's a door right around the left 
corner.  Go into it.

EXHIBIT ROOM 3
In this room, you'll find HANDGUN BULLETS, as well as some paintings and 
notes about Toluca Prison Camp.

MYSTERY CORRIDOR
Continue down the corridor, and go into the door you come to.

HOLE ROOM
This room features the hole you might have seen in the painting in 
EXHIBIT ROOM 2.  It's too dark to see the bottom.  There's nowhere else 
to go, so you might as well jump down in.  James is a bit hesitant to 
jump down of course, but he'll do it anyway.

WATER WELL
At first, it looks as if you've made a real crap mistake jumping down 
here, as there's no doors, and the walls are too steep to climb on.  Are 
we trapped here forever?!  Don't lose your hope though, because there IS 
a way out of here.  Closely examine every inch of the wall, until James 
detects a spot that's different.  Break down the wall with your PIPE, 
and a secret door will be revealed.  Go through it.

[Note: If you don't have the PIPE with you right now, then it's because 
you skipped over it before.  Go to the gas station in WESTERN SILENT 
HILL right now and get the PIPE from the car that's running there right 
now. CVXFREAK: Or alternatively, you can use the PLANK.]

SEWER
Turn right, and walk down the hall until you come to a fork.  You'll see 
steps leading up to a dry platform.  The door to the right is open.  
Take it.

HOLE ROOM 2
You can see another hole ahead of you, but this one is blocked by a 
fence.  You have to unlock the gate.  Take the door on the right side of 
the hall before the hole.

BUG ROOM
You'll see the SPIRAL-WRITING KEY for the hole in the other room, so 
grab it.  But no, it's not that simple.  Your FLASHLIGHT'S battery 
chooses that moment to run out, so use the DRY CELL BATTERY you found at 
Brookhaven Hospital to get your FLASHLIGHT working again.  Now the 
room's full of bugs, and the door's locked with a combination lock.

There are 9 numbers, but notice how only three are lit up.  You need to 
press the lit buttons in a certain order to unlock the door.  There 
aren't any clues as to what the combination is, so just guess what the 
code is until you get it right.  There's only like a handful of possible 
codes to try anyway.

HOLE ROOM 2
Use the SPIRAL-WRITING KEY to unlock the gate on the floor, then jump 
down the hole like last time.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOLUCA PRISON
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

PRISON CAFETERIA
How in the world did some hole just land us in some Civil War era 
prison?  Anyway, you'll run into Eddie here, who's acting pretty crazy.  
He says killing's no big deal, and says he shot the guy next to him, and 
says he also shot a dog too.  He says that guy was looking at him weird, 
and James says that's no reason to kill somebody.  Eddie then says he 
was just kidding.  He says the guy was already dead when he got here, 
and leaves the room.

After Eddie leaves, get the TABLET OF "GLUTTONOUS PIG" from the back of 
the room, a HEALTH DRINK off a cart, another HEALTH DRINK off a table, 
and if you want to, save at the SAVE POINT on a column here.

WEST CORRIDOR
Turn left and run down the hall.  Ignore all the doors you see for now.  
At a desk at the first gate, you'll find HANDGUN BULLETS.  When you come 
to a second gate, you'll find the MAP OF THE PRISON on the desk.  Like 
all maps in this game, it's VITAL that you have it.  Go to the door on 
the east side of the hall which leads into a room which holds several 
others.

SHOWERS
Go to the northern bank of showers, and enter the one at the end of the 
row. Inside, you'll find the TABLET OF "THE SEDUCTRESS."  Leave.

WEST CORRIDOR
Go to the southern rows of cells, and enter the northern corridor of the 
cell block.

SOUTH CELL BLOCK
You'll see many cells in here, but the only ones you can get into are 
the ones that have their doors open already.  In the first open cell, 
you'll get HANDGUN BULLETS.  In the second cell, which is laden with 
occult items, you'll find the WAX DOLL.  Exit through the eastern door.

EAST CORRIDOR
As you pass through the first gate heading north, you'll find HANDGUN 
BULLETS on a table.  Go through the double doors on the west side at the 
middle point of the hall.

UNIFORM ROOM
Grab the RIFLE SHELLS here, then leave.

EAST CORRIDOR
Continue walking north down the hall.  Enter the southern corridor of 
the northern cell block.

NORTH CELL BLOCK
You can hear some weird noises in here, but ignore them.  They are only 
there to creep you out.  The doors this time aren't open.  You'll have 
to check the doors yourself.  In the first cell from the east, you'll 
see that the inmate who used to be here loved painting.  You can look at 
the "463 People at a Recital" painting, or the "Burning Man" painting.

The cell you should be interested in going to is the fourth cell from 
the west.  Get the TABLET OF "THE OPPRESSOR" in here, then exit through 
the eastern door.

EAST CORRIDOR
Go to the door that leads into the MASSIVE area on the east side of the 
map.

GALLOWS YARD
The first time I came in here, I was expecting some massive boss 
encounter.  Turns out I was wrong.  In the center of this yard is the 
hanging platform.  Place the TABLET OF "GLUTTONOUS PIG," the "TABLET OF 
"THE SEDUCTRESS," and the TABLET OF "THE OPPRESSOR" in the platform.  
You'll hear a scream, but nothing else happens!

Now what are we supposed to do?  Since it seems nothing has happened, 
let's leave.  Hanging from the handle of the door is the HORSESHOE.  It 
looks like we got something after all.  Take it and leave the yard.

EAST CORRIDOR
Go to the NORTH CELL BLOCK.

NORTH CELL BLOCK
Cross through the room to the western door.

WEST CORRIDOR
There should be two doors across the hall from you that you can open.  
Take 
the one to the south first.

SOUTH VISITING ROOM
In here, get the FIRST-AID KIT.  On the other side, you can see a 
LIGHTER, but the glass is in the way.  You'll have to leave.

WEST CORRIDOR
Take the northernmost door you can reach.

NORTH VISITING ROOM
The table and glass in the middle has been totally destroyed, so you can 
reach the visitors part of the jail.  Go through to the next corridor.

VISITORS' CORRIDOR
Go into the SOUTH VISITING ROOM.

SOUTH VISITING ROOM
You're on the other side of the glass now, and can get the LIGHTER.  
Leave.

VISITORS' CORRIDOR
Skip over the next door on the east side of the hall, and enter the next 
door to the south.

WOMEN'S RESTROOM
This room's only good for a little scare.  Try knocking on the closed 
stall door, then walk away.

VISTORS' CORRIDOR
Go into the next door to the south.

MEN'S RESTROOM
In here, you'll find a SAVE POINT if you need it.

VISITORS' CORRIDOR
Take the one door on the west side of the hall that's unlocked.

GUARDS' LOUNGE
In here, you can find an AMPOULE, a FIRST-AID KIT, and a HEALTH DRINK.  
Take the door on the northern wall.

ARMORY
Inside this room, you can get a box of HANDGUN BULLETS, a box of SHOTGUN 
SHELLS, two boxes of RIFLE SHELLS, and (dun dun DUHHHH!) the HUNTING 
RIFLE!  We now have the most powerful gun in the game!  It shoots more 
slowly though, can only hold four bullets, and can only hurt one enemy.  
Save it for bosses.  Leave the room.

GUARDS' LOUNGE
Go out into the hall.

VISITORS' CORRIDOR
You might want to save in the MEN'S RESTROOM.  After you have saved, go 
through the iron gate.  Examine the hatch on the floor then.  You can't 
lift it up because it doesn't have a handle.  There's only a hole where 
it once was.  Don't worry though, because you have all the stuff you 
need to improvise a new handle.  Combine the WAX DOLL, the LIGHTER, and 
the HORSESHOE to melt the wax into the hole, and to use the HORSESHOE as 
the handle.  Lift up the cover and jump down in.

BASEMENT CELL BLOCK
All the cells are locked, and the stairs are blocked off too, so your 
only choice is to go through the double doors that aren't marked on the 
map.

MORGUE
In here, you'll see dozens of corpses in the holes in the walls.  
Thankfully James won't have to search any of the holes to get items.  
This room's only here to gross you out really.  Continue to the next 
door.

HOLE ROOM 3
ANOTHER HOLE?!  James is one determined guy.  I would have given up long 
ago, back at the first hole.  I'm terrified of heights.  No way I could 
stomach leaping down holes that you can't even see the bottom of.  
Anyway, JUMP!

HOLE ROOM 4
After James gets up, open the nearby door.  ANOTHER HOLE!?!?!?!  Jump 
down again anyway.

ELEVATOR SHAFT
Walk into the nearby elevator.  While it proceeds even further downward 
to it's destination, grab the FIRST-AID KIT, the RIFLE SHELLS, the 
SHOTGUN SHELLS, and the HANDGUN BULLETS.  When the elevator arrives, 
walk out and save at the SAVE POINT here.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
LABYRINTH
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 1
Welcome to the Labyrinth.  This place is real confusing.  Though there 
isn't a map of this area, James will draw his own map as you move 
through the maze.  Keep your FLASHLIGHT on at all times, so James can 
have the light to draw with.

Turn right at the fork with the door blocked by wires.  Go straight at 
the next fork, then turn left when the path goes left and right.  You'll 
come to another fork.  Each fork leads to a ladder, but they both go to 
the same room anyway.

OCTAGON CORRIDOR
Down here, you'll run into monkeys hanging off the bottom of the fence 
walkways, and Pyramid Head is also walking around here too.  If you want 
him to go away, scare him off with the RIFLE.  Run around in here until 
you find a door.  Take it.

PYRAMID HEAD'S ROOM
It could be his room, because it's got his skewered victims hanging from 
the ceiling, and his GREAT KNIFE is on the bloody table with two boxes 
of SHOTGUN SHELLS.  Wonder why he's got ammo in here?  It'd be real 
scary if he started coming after you with guns!

Anyways, if you're thinking now "Mwahahaha!  Now I'll kill that idiot 
Pyramid Head with his own weapon!" then you'll probably be wrong, 
because you have to drag it behind you like Pyramid Head does, and you 
can only do slow horizontal swings and one real slow overhead swing.  
Walk out of the room.

OCTAGON CORRIDOR
Climb out of here at either of the ladders.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 1
Go back down the hall from the ladders, and go straight at the fork.  
You'll come to a ladder going down into a pit that blocks the hall.

WATER CORRIDOR 1
Walk to the ladder at the other end of the hall.

STATUE HEAD ROOM

BLOCK PUZZLE
************

In the middle of this room is an odd cube with faces on every side of 
it.  Each face has a different eye color.  This cube controls the 
rotation of the next room, meaning whichever way the cube is rotated, 
that's the way the room will go.  You have to rotate the cube until you 
have an open door to the next room.  The solution is random as to what 
head with the colored eyes needs to be facing you, so you'll just have 
to keep guessing until you get it right.

MARIA'S JAIL CELL
Once you get it right, go through the open door, and you'll find Maria 
in a jail cell.  She's alive and doesn't have a scratch on her, but 
how?!  We saw Pyramid Head kill her in the hall at the hospital.  She 
says you only got "separated" from her, and she even says some memories 
about their time in the Lake View Hotel that are supposed to be Mary's.  
Anyway, you now have to run through the maze again and find the way 
around those bars.

STATUE HEAD ROOM
When you come back in, you can hear an odd buzzing noise.  Next to the 
ladder, you can see an electrical box has been tampered with, and 
someone left behind his WIRE CUTTER.  Take it and go down the ladder.

WATER CORRIDOR 2
Go through the hall to the other ladder.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 1
Use your map to get back to the door blocked by wires, and use the WIRE 
CUTTER to get them out of the way.  Climb down the ladder here.

WATER CORRIDOR 2
Take the right fork down here.  Going straight will lead you to a dead 
end at LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 2.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 3
Turn right and go down the ladder at the end of the hall.

WATER CORRIDOR 3
This corridor becomes a loop if you look at your map while walking.  The 
exit is the door in the corridor just around the corner from the west 
corridor.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 4
At the first fork, turn right.  When you get to the chainlink fence, 
walk left around behind the fence to find the next ladder.

WATER CORRIDOR 4
When you get to the fork, go left.  The straight fork leads to a dead 
end room.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 5
You'll know you're on the right track if you find HANDGUN BULLETS next 
to you when you get into this room.  Walk down the short hall to the 
next ladder.

WATER CORRIDOR 5
You better watch out because Pyramid Head's down here waiting on you.  
If you want some extra ammo, go straight at the fork.  You'll enter a 
path that loops.  Take the ladder up.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 6
In here, you'll find two boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS.

WATER CORRIDOR 5
To get to the next hall, take the ladder to the east.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 7
In this small room, you'll find a bloody newspaper and a SAVE POINT.  
Save 
your game and go through the door.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 8
In here, you'll see newspapers scattered everywhere, and a little 
further 
down the hall, you'll hear Angela yell "No daddy!  Please don't!" from 
behind a door covered with newspaper.  James runs inside.

ANGELA'S ROOM
You'll find Angela cornered by a huge monster, that looks like its got a 
door stuck to it.  Pull out your shotgun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================
DIFFICULTY: Medium
Pound this guy hard with SHOTGUN SHELLS.  After around 10+ hit's, it'll 
die.

It's one attack is very devestating.  It looks like the monster jumps on 
you then proceeds to chomp on your head.  This can kill you in three 
hits, so monitor your health carefully and heal after every two hits.  
The boss is fairly slow, and the SHOTGUN'S fast, so you should not have 
to worry much though.  Keep track of your ammo and don't get caught in a 
reloading animation.

The RIFLE may be stronger, but it's too slow.  The boss will be able to 
keep up with you between shots.
===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you knock down the monster, Angela then proceeds to kick the 
monster in the head, and then drop a TV set on it's head to kill it.  
James tells Angela to calm down, but she yells at him to quit ordering 
her around.  Angela then accuses James of wanting him to be after only 
one thing.  She asks if James's wife is dead.  James says yes, then 
Angela yells that he's a liar and he probably just found someone else.  
Angela then runs out.  Leave the room too.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 8
Go to the door at the end of the hall.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 9
Take the door next to you.

CRIMINALS' ROOM
You can see six corpses of men who have been hung for various crimes.  
Learn which man is responsible for each crime, by reading the papers on 
their faces, then go out into the hall.  Remember where in the room they 
are standing.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 9
Go to the other end of the hall.  Take the door on the left.

NOOSE ROOM
In here, you'll see the exact same room as the CRIMINALS' ROOM, only the 
corpses have been replaced by hanging nooses.  The goal is to pull the 
noose of the man who was innocent.  You do this by reading the poem 
written on the wall.  Look carefully at which crime the man was accused 
of without any proof, or which crime is not mentioned in the poem at 
all.  If you can't figure it out, then look at the solutions below:

EASY MODE: The Kidnapper is innocent.

NORMAL MODE: The Arsonist is innocent.

HARD: The Counterfeiter is innocent.

Pull the rope that is in the place of the man who is innocent, then 
leave the room.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 9
If you pulled the wrong rope, the hall will be full of monsters.  If you 
are right, and haven't gotten wrong before, then there will be no 
monsters.  Go to the CRIMINALS' ROOM if you got it right.

CRIMINALS' ROOM
In the place of the man who you found to be innocent, there will be the 
KEY OF THE PERSECUTED.  Leave.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 9
Go to the other end of the hall, and take the other door you haven't 
tried yet.

LABYRINTH CORRIDOR 10
Go down the hall, and you'll find a rolled down gate.  Use the KEY OF 
THE PERSECUTED to unlock the handcuffs holding the valve, then turn the 
valve to bring the gate up.  Go down the ladder.

WATER CORRIDOR 6
Go down the hall, and head straight at the fork.

MARIA'S JAIL CELL
You're too late, someone came in while you were gone and killed Maria.  
Twice Maria has been killed before your eyes.  Who did it this time?  
James will then leave the room.

WATER CORRIDOR 6
Climb the ladder down the fork with the long hall.

GRAVEYARD
Take the FIRST-AID KIT in front of you, then enter the graveyard.  If 
you search around, you can find three boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS, and an 
AMPOULE.  There's a SAVE POINT on one of the graves if you need to save.  
Also, look at some of the names on the gravestones.  Miriam K. - 
"Traitor," and Walter Sullivan, the guy who murdered those two kids in 
the gossip magazine article.

There are also three graves ready to accept new corpses.  Eddie 
Dombrowski, and Angela Orosco...what?  The characters we met during this 
adventure?  Those graves are for them?!    What does this last one say?  
Uh oh, it says James Sunderland...  This grave doesn't have a bottom.  
There's nowhere else to go, so you might as well jump down.

MISTY CORRIDOR
You might want to equip your SHOTGUN or RIFLE.  Walk down the stairs, 
and enter the door at the end of the hall.

COLD ROOM
You'll confront Eddie, who's REALLY gone psycho.  He killed everyone in 
this room, and says it doesn't matter what you were like when you're 
alive, it's just all the same when you're dead.  He did it because he 
said he's not going to let anyone laugh at him from now on.  James asks 
him if he's gone nuts, and Eddie takes that as laughing at him.  He 
decides to kill James too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
Start shooting Eddie after he finishes talking.  Don't EVER let him 
shoot you.  One hit will take you down to bottom health.  Fortunately, 
it takes him awhile to draw his gun and fire a shot.

If you want to, you can beat him with the PIPE or the PLANK.  Be sure to 
trap him in a corner before doing this.  Usually, he'll punch you if you 
hit him with a blunt object.  Sometimes, he'll keep trying to draw his 
gun, but you can hit him hard during the slow aiming animation.  Every 
time he is hit, he'll have to start the animation over.

When he's hurt bad enough, he'll retreat to the next room.  Before you 
chase after him, gather up the SHOTGUN SHELLS and the RIFLE SHELLS.

MEAT LOCKER
Eddie will mouth off some more at James about being hated all his life, 
and brags about him killing that dog and the guy who came after him.  
When he stops talking, he'll come out of hiding and start attacking 
again.  This time, he'll take more damage.  Eddie has more room to move 
around, so you might be forced to use a gun this time.

The fight will then end with Eddie falling dead on the floor.  James is 
very sad due to the fact he actually killed another human being.  He is 
still wondering if Mary really did die three years ago.
===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you kill Eddie, exit through the big doors on the opposite side of 
the room from the door you used to get in.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOAT ADVENTURE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

BOAT LAUNCH
It feels good to be outside again in daylight, especially after that 
long journey through those claustrophobic dark corridors.  Walk down the 
right side of the path.  If you want to save, there's a SAVE POINT on 
the oil drum before you walk onto the pier.

Walk down the wooden pier where a rowboat is.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Restless Dreams players: If you have the BLUE GEM, use it right now if 
you have it. You'll end up with a new ending.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may see that light  through the fog.  That's where you need to go.  
Press X at the boat and  James will climb inside.  Just turn right and 
then row towards the light in the distance for about a minute to get to 
the Lake Side Hotel.

On Easy and Normal Mode, head toward the light by simply pressing the D-
Pad. Turn right when you get on and run toward the light.  On Hard mode, 
you must use the twin sticks. OK. Start by rotating both sticks right. 
You should see the light.  Now turn the left stick left and the right 
stick right, both at the same time.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAVE VIEW HOTEL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

HOTEL BACK LAWN
James will comment that this place hasn't changed at all in three years.  
Walk off the dock, up the stairs, and onto the back lawn.  Turn left and 
look for a fountain in the shape of a bird.  Here you will find the 
"LITTLE MERMAID" MUSIC BOX.  Go inside through the back door.

FIRST FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Grab the HOTEL MAP (FOR GUESTS) from the board to your left.  This time, 
you can see somebody wrote "Waiting for you..." on ROOM 312, the room 
Mary and James stayed in the last time they were here.  Could Mary 
really be there?  We'll just have to hurry up and get up there!

Now, if you are thinking of just rushing up the stairs to the third 
floor to rescue your fair damsel, don't bother.  You'll get stopped by a 
security gate before you can get into the third floor corridor.  Enter 
RESTAURANT "LAKE SHORE" to the east.

RESTAURANT "LAKE SHORE"
Walk near the piano, and there's a sudden burst of music.  Laura climbs 
out from behind the piano, and asks if he's here looking for Mary.  
Laura says she's here looking for her too.  Laura gives him a letter 
from Mary.  In the letter, Mary tells her not to be to hard on James, 
and wishes her a happy eighth birthday.

After speaking with Laura, James finds out that her birthday was a week 
ago, which means if Mary did die, she only passed away a week ago, which 
means, she really could be up there, waiting for James...  Laura is 
about to show James another letter, but she realizes she dropped it, and 
runs out the door to find it.  James tries to stop her but she gets 
away.

Get the "FISH" KEY from the dinner plate on the one table with a 
tablecloth. Leave.

FIRST FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Take the single door on the south side of the hall nearest the double 
doors leading to the hall with the guest rooms.  It's not marked on your 
map, as this is a guest map, which does not cover employee areas.

WEST EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Go into the one room in this hall that has its door open.  Grab the one 
box of RIFLE SHELLS, and the three boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS.  Leave.

FIRST FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Go down to the basement.

BASEMENT CORRIDOR
Walk to the end of the hall where the elevator car is sitting idle.  
Inside, you'll find the THINNER.  Go back upstairs again.

FIRST FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Enter the LOBBY through one of its doors.

LOBBY
You'll find a SAVE POINT on one of the chairs in here if you need to use 
it.   Go to the reception desk.  On it you'll find a note addressed to 
you from the hotel staff.  It says that the video tape you left behind 
here is being kept in the first floor office.  Walk behind the counter.

RECEPTION COUNTER
Coincidentally, the only key in the key box is the exact key you need to 
get to where you need to go.  Take the KEY TO ROOM 312 and go into the 
LOBBY again.

LOBBY
Look at the music box in the middle of the room.  There are three slots.  
Each of them fits your "LITTLE MERMAID" MUSIC BOX well, but we only have 
one, so there must be two more somewhere around here.  Run upstairs to 
the second floor balcony.  Take the double doors to the east.

SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR
Grab the HEALTH DRINK, and the RIFLE SHELLS.  Leave the room through the 
same door.

LOBBY
Run across the balcony to the other set of double doors to the west.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Go inside the CLOAK ROOM.

CLOAK ROOM
Get the FIRST-AID KIT, the two boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS, and the two 
boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS.  Use the "FISH" KEY to unlock the black 
briefcase on the counter.  Inside, you'll find the KEY TO ROOM 204.  
Leave.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Go into the READING ROOM.

READING ROOM
Get the two boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS, and the HEALTH DRINK.  Leave.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Take the double doors into the next part of the hallway.  Go to ROOM 204 
and use the KEY TO ROOM 204 to unlock the door.  Go inside.

ROOM 204/ROOM 202
Get the EMPLOYEE ELEVATOR KEY off the desk in ROOM 204, then walk 
through the hole in the wall to ROOM 202.  If you examine the suitcase, 
you'll see it's locked with a combination, but you don't know what it 
is.  Examine the photographs on the bed.

One of them shows the suitcase's combination lock, but it's been colored 
over with a marker.  Use the THINNER to make the marker wear away and 
reveal the code.  It's random, so I can't tell you what it is.  Use the 
code from the photo on the suitcase to open it and get the "CINDERELLA" 
MUSIC BOX.  Go out into the hall.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Go onto the second floor balcony again.

LOBBY
Walk across the balcony to the SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR.

SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR
Go to the door on the wall past the elevator, and use the EMPLOYEE 
ELEVATOR KEY to unlock the door.

EMPLOYEE ELEVATOR ROOM

Get the two HEALTH DRINKS from the cart.  There is a SAVE POINT in here 
if you need it.  Try to board the elevator.  It seems there's a weight 
limit.  Since James hasn't been too good about losing those extra 
pounds, we're going to have to leave all of our items on the shelf next 
to the elevator.

That's right, EVERY LAST ITEM, right down to the FLASHLIGHT and that 
photograph of Mary you had at the start of the game.  After you have 
deposited every single item, you may now board the elevator and ride it 
to the first floor.  Don't sweat it, because you won't encounter much 
resistance while running around itemless.

EAST EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Get the HOTEL MAP (FOR EMPLOYEES) off the bulletin board to the left.  
Now, finally, you have a map for the entire hotel, and not just areas 
allowed to guests.  The office mentioned in the memo about the video 
tape is just around the corner to the left.  Go inside.

OFFICE
Look inside the safe beneath the pile of boxes to get the VIDEOTAPE and 
the CAN OPENER.  Leave the room.

EAST EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Go inside the EMPLOYEE LOUNGE.

EMPLOYEE LOUNGE
On top of the fridge, you'll find two boxes of RIFLE SHELLS.  Leave.

EAST EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Go to the PANTRY.

PANTRY
In here, you'll find the "SNOW WHITE" MUSIC BOX.  We got all three music 
boxes now!  Leave.

EAST EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
All the rest of the doors you can't get through, so you ought to go to 
the stairs and head for the basement.

EMPLOYEE STAIRWELL
Go down to the basement.

BASEMENT EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Go to the ELECTRICAL ROOM.

ELECTRICAL ROOM
Get the FIRST-AID KIT, then walk around the corner and get the BAR KEY.  
Leave.

BASEMENT EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Go to the KITCHEN.

KITCHEN
Grab the three HEALTH DRINKS, then look at the unmarked can on the 
counter.  Use the CAN OPENER, and inside you'll find a LIGHT BULB.  
Mmmm...light bulbs.  Maybe we can use them to make a light snack, heh.  
Anyway, take the light bulb and enter the BAR "VENUS TEARS."

BAR "VENUS TEARS"
If you try to use the BAR KEY to unlock the front door, James will make 
up a lame excuse not to open it.  It's because it's too dark to see the 
keyhole.  Oh brother, I don't have that much trouble unlocking doors 
with keys in the dark in real life.  Anyway, to help our visually 
challenged friend James, place the LIGHT BULB in the lamp on the counter 
nearby to shine a light on the door.  Now James will be able to unlock 
the door.

BASEMENT CORRIDOR
Run upstairs.

FIRST FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Run upstairs again.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Walk out onto the balcony in the LOBBY.

LOBBY
Run across the balcony to the SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR.

SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR
Ener the EMPLOYEE ELEVATOR ROOM.

EMPLOYEE ELEVATOR ROOM
Get all your stuff back, then go out again.

SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR
Go into the LOBBY again.

LOBBY
Run downstairs to the music box on the first floor.  Now, you can either 
use the clues you get by reading the words beneath the indentations for 
the music boxes.  The combinations change from difficulty level to 
difficulty level, but the center one will always be the "LITTLE MERMAID" 
MUSIC BOX.  After the boxes are in the correct places, play the music 
box and you'll get the HOTEL STAIRWAY KEY.  Finally we can get into ROOM 
312 and see if Mary really is there...  Well don't just stand there!  
Run upstairs and enter the SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Go upstairs.

THIRD FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Use the HOTEL STAIRWAY KEY to remove that annoying security gate, then 
use the KEY TO ROOM 312 to unlock ROOM 312.  Go inside and see what's 
waiting for you...

ROOM 312
WE FINALLY MADE IT!!!  But...nobody's here, and the bathroom's locked 
up, so nobody is in there either. 

[Restless Dreams players: If you have the BLUE GEM, use it right now 
over by the window if you have it. You'll end up with a new ending.]

Go to the TV set near the big windows, and use the VIDEOTAPE on the VCR.  
You'll get to witness one of James's last vacationing day here at the 
hotel.  Mary talks about how much she loves it in Silent Hill, and asks 
James if they could come back again someday.

She then coughs some, and the videotape suddenly gets a lot of static.  
We see another fuzzy scene.  James is visiting with Mary at her bedside 
when she was sick.  He talks to her some, then grabs the pillow from 
underneath her and holds the pillow on top of her, causing her to die by 
running out of breath.

The tape then fades into video snow, and James stares at the floor, 
finally remembering how Mary really died.  He killed her.  Laura runs 
in, and asks if he found Mary or not.  James finally admits that she's 
dead and he killed her.  Laura yells at James that he's a killer and she 
hates him.  Laura then leaves the room.

He then hears a radio message over his pocket radio.  Mary is calling 
out to James to find her, and saying she's nearby.  Walk out of the 
room.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DARK LAKE VIEW HOTEL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

THIRD FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
You'll discover that Misty Silent Hill has now transformed again into 
Dark Silent Hill.  If you need it, there's a SAVE POINT down the hall on 
the door to ROOM 313.  Go downstairs.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Go to the READING ROOM.

READING ROOM
On the desk, you'll find a pair of headphones.  Listening to them will 
likely change your ending.  You don't have to do it if you don't want 
to.  It depends on what else you've done during the game.  Go out into 
the hall again.

SECOND FLOOR WEST CORRIDOR
Go into the hall with the guests' rooms.  The doors are all wierd now, 
and will warp you to other doors in this hall, or the doors of the 
guests' rooms in the SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR.  I'll run down a list 
of where you'll go depending on which door you pick.  The arrow 
indicates which door you'll go to after choosing a door:

ROOM 207 > ROOM 204

ROOM 204 > ROOM 207

ROOM 202 > ROOM 219

ROOM 219 > ROOM 220

ROOM 220 > ROOM 207

ROOM 212 > ROOM 202

So, you ought to pick ROOM 202 to warp to the next hallway.

SECOND FLOOR EAST CORRIDOR
On the windowsill in this hall, you'll get two boxes of HANDGUN BULLETS.  
Go to the double doors in this hall.  Head for the guests' elevator.  
Before stepping on, take the two AMPOULES from the table nearby.  Ride 
the elevator to the basement.

BASEMENT CORRIDOR
WHOA!  The basement's full of water!  Enter the BAR "VENUS TEARS."  I 
guess Venus really did shed some tears. (CVXFREAK: LOL!)

BAR "VENUS TEARS"
Behind the counter, grab the five HEALTH DRINKS.  Go into the KITCHEN.

KITCHEN
Inside here, you'll find a FIRST-AID KIT, two boxes of SHOTGUN SHELLS, 
and two boxes of RIFLE SHELLS.  Go into the EMPLOYEE BASEMENT CORRIDOR

EMPLOYEE BASEMENT CORRIDOR
Go to the stairs.  All the doors down here are locked.

FIERY STAIRWELL
Inside here, you'll run into Angela, amidst blazing flames which are 
consuming everything..  When she sees you, she'll think you're her mama.  
She then realizes you're James.  She thanks you for saving her, but 
wishes you hadn't.  She then gets a little edgy and sarcastically asks 
if you'll take care of her, love her, save her, etc., and then says 
"That's just what I thought."

She asks for the knife back, and James says no.  He asks if he's saving 
it for himself.  He denies it, then she starts up the stairs.  Flames 
then separate them, and James finally admits it's hot as hell in here.  
Angela then says for her it's always like this.  Walk back out of the 
room.

EMPLOYEE STAIRWELL
Now you're inside the real stairwell.  Go up to the first floor.

EAST EMPLOYEE CORRIDOR
Go near the bathrooms, and you can find two AMPOULES on a table near the 
doors.  Every door in here is locked, save the back door at the 
northeastern part of the hall.  Go through it.

OUTSIDE HALL
Wierd, isn't it?  You should be outside, the map even shows it, but 
you're still inside.  Go down the long hall, avoiding the monkeys under 
the fencing floor.

OUTSIDE ROOM
Another room where you should be outside but you're still inside.  You 
can see nine SAVE POINTS on the wall over there.  What's the point of 
that?  Save, because things are about to get pretty tricky.  Walk 
through the front door.

LOBBY
Inside, you'll see Maria alive again!  She's about to be executed on the 
balcony, but the stairs are gone so you can't rescue her.  Two Pyramid 
Heads stand on either side.  One drives a spear into her and she dies.  
James admits he was weak, and needed Maria to punish him for his sins.  
The Pyramid Heads then come down to kill James.  James says he's going 
to end this now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================
DIFFICULTY: FAIRLY HARD
This is where your skills as a Silent Hill 2 gamer are tested. This
boss is like the one you faced in the Blue Creek Apartments- except
there are TWO of them!

Also, you MUST shoot them this time, instead of just dodge like in the
Blue Creek Apartments and at the labyrinth and hospital.

Load the Shotgun. It is faster than the Hunting Rifle, yet slightly
weaker than the Hunting Rifle. Which should you choose?

Like the battle with Eddie at the Labyrinth, quickness is more than
power. If you are slow, the Pyramid Heads will slash you up into
pieces.

If the shots are powerful, you can squeeze by with one shot before
running again. There are 2 different strategies here. One for the
Shotgun and one for the Rifle, since different gamers can utilize bth
weapons their own way.

================
SHOTGUN STRATEGY
================
Load the Shotgun. Get as far from either one as possible. Then start
firing. Fire 2 shots and move around them as they approach. They are
slightly slow, yet slightly fast.

Shoot them in a 2 shot pattern. You might get hit in the process- use a
Health Drink or Ampoule. The Ampoule will protect you from damage for
10 seconds- so this might be the time to equip the Rifle and fire off 5
powerful shots.

19-25 shots should kill them. Pyramid Head's gone now! YAY! Take THAT, 
punk! [That bastard who killed me twice!]

**************
RIFLE STRATEGY
**************
So you like the Rifle better? OK, that's fine. Load your rifle and run
to a corner, far from them. Fire one shot. If they are pretty far, shoot 
again and run. Run far from them, since they are medium distance in 
moving. Fire one shot or two shots, again. Run to the first corner you 
were in and repeat.

15-18 shots kill them at long last.

****************
HANDGUN STRATEGY
****************
This is the way I, Minesweeper, did it the first time.  Equip the 
HANDGUN, run to a corner of the room, count and fire three shots, run to 
the next corner, fire three shots, next corner, fire three shots, fourth 
corner, fire one shot and reload.  Repeat this pattern and after about 
100 bullets they'll die.  This takes a real long time to do though.
===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you win, the Pyramid Heads will stab themselves through their 
heads with their own spears.  Search them for a SCARLET EGG and a RUST-
COLORED EGG.  Go to the two doors on the south side of the arena.  Put 
the SCARLET EGG in the right door and the RUST-COLORED EGG in the left 
door.  Then go through one of them.

FIRST FLOOR MIDDLE CORRIDOR
Go through the back door you used to get in here when you first arrived.

CONVERSATION HALLWAY
On your way down the hall, you can hear a conversation between Mary and 
James while she was still ill in the hospital.  If you listen to the 
whole conversation, it can change your ending.  At the very end of this 
long hallway is a door.  Enter it, or wait till the conversation ends 
and then go through it if you want to change your ending.

LONG STAIRWELL
Turn left and go up the long series of stairs, and into a large room at 
the top.

ROOF
In here, the final boss is waiting...

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Scroll down... way down!)

Anyway, you must fight a boss. Arm... whatever you want to arm, because
like the last boss, there are 2 strategies to use here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================
BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER
=======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
Compared to Eddie, she's a total wimp. Arm whatever you want.

So what should you arm? For the challenge, use the Handgun. For the mid
challenge, use the Shotgun. For the real challenge, use the Hunting
Rifle.

************
HANDGUN TIPS
************
For the Handgun, you must learn to run, shoot, run and shoot. If you
fought Pyramid Head with the Handgun at the Blue Creek Apartment
Building, you might know how to do it. Shoot, run, shoot, run is the 
strategy. Since the gun is quick, 3 shots can be fired before you must 
run again. Take advantage of the smallness and quickness of this gun. If 
the boss can never hit you, just pelting it with one bullet before 
running again can guarantee you a victory. I won't suggest this 
strategy, but merely if you want the challenge. It's harder than you 
believe!

**********
RIFLE TIPS
**********
The Rifle is the strongest and slowest weapon- major sacrifice! Shoot
one shot and run. If you're lucky, the bosses' flies won't hit you. Use 
the strategy from the Pyramid Head fight to beat this boss. I'll repeat 
it:

-----
So you like the Rifle better? OK, that's fine. Load your rifle and run
to a corner, far from them. Fire one shot. If they are pretty far, shoot 
again and run. Run far from them, since they are medium distance in 
moving. Fire one shot or two shots, again. Run to the first corner you 
were in and repeat.

15-18 shots kill them at long last.
-----

************
SHOTGUN TIPS
************
Use the strategy you used on Pyramid Head and Eddie to kill the boss. 
I'll repeat it:

-----
Load the Shotgun. Get as far from either one as possible. Then start
firing. Fire 2 shots and move around them as they approach. They are
slightly slow, yet slightly fast.

Shoot them in a 2 shot pattern. You might get hit in the process- use a
Health Drink or Ampoule. The Ampoule will protect you from damage for
10 seconds- so this might be the time to equip the Rifle and fire off 5
powerful shots.

19-25 shots should kill them. Pyramid Head's gone now! YAY! Take THAT, 
punk! [That bastard who killed me twice!]
-----

One last shot once the boss is on the ground will kill this freak.

BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER

END GAME
********

You have beaten the damn game already, though it was rather short!
Enjoy your ending!

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BORN FROM A WISH WALKTHROUGH (RESTLESS DREAMS ONLY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

After the cut-scenes, head out of the room into the main room of the 
Heaven's Night bar. Grab the Chinese Cleaver on the counter and then 
exit the room. 

Head south on Caroll Street. Then head east on Rendell and then head 
north on Munson Street. Hug the right side of the Munson and when you 
reach a door with blood in front of it (near the Blue Creek Apartment 
Buildings), enter through.

This is the Baldwin Mansion, so enter through the front doors. In this 
Entry Hall, run up to the double doors to enter the mansion proper. Turn 
to the door to the very left. Inside this next room, climb the stairs 
and try opening the door to the right. 

Skip the cut-scene. After the cut-scene, head through the only open door 
nearby. In this hallway, dodge the Mannequin. Head to the door to the 
very right from where you entered the hallway from. In this balcony is a 
White Board.

Return to the first floor. On your way down, you'll hear a clatter. Head 
to the Main Room and then examine the Fire Place. A new ladder will be 
revealed. Climb it to some sort of a graveyard.

Grab the Red Board and the Black Board and prepare for a puzzle. Examine 
the tombstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACACIA PUZZLE
*************
To solve this, place the White Board in first. Then Place the Red Board 
in, but turn it to the left. Then insert the Black Board as is and you 
will get the Acacia Key.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take this key back to the second floor. Once in the Hallway where you 
talked to Ernest, take the only open door again. In this hall where you 
dodged the Mannequin, proceed down into another door. 

Through this door is another balcony above the Main Room. Across is a 
locked door. Use the Acacia Key to unlock it. Go through this long hall, 
passed one blocked door to an unlocked door. This is a bedroom.

Grab the Matches and leave. Continue down the hall outside the bedroom 
until you come to another unlocked door. It leads to an attic. Climb it. 
As you climb, you will hear a voice.

At the top of the stairs, use the Matches on the candles to light the 
room. Then look underneath a big chair to find a Birthday Card. Return 
down the stairs to hear a voice.

Return to the door where you saw Ernest. It is unlocked now. So head 
through. Head through another door to a noisy hallway. Take the only 
open door and head down a long hallway.

Through the next door is a kitchen. Grab any items and head through 
another door. Through it is a hallway. Look to your left for a locked 
door and a save pad. 

Remember that locked door. Head through the nearest door that is 
unlocked and head inside. The room is marked "Study" on the Map. Head to 
the other door. Talk to Ernest again.

Now go to the locked door you saw a minute ago. You might want to save 
your game. Head down the stairs and down a long hallway. Head up another 
flight of stairs, through a door and you are outside again. Look for a 
hole in the fence and enter the blue door you see nearby.

You are in the Blue Creek Apartments. Head through the first door you 
see. In this hall, turn to the first door to Maria's left. In Room 105, 
head to the locked cabinet and grab the White Liquid. 

Return to the where you last talked to Ernest. After a few cut-scenes, 
this rather short mini game is over! 

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Modes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

There are 4 difficulty modes in Silent Hill 2. They are Hard, Normal,
Easy and Beginner. The hardest difficulty is well, hard. Middle
difficulty ranges in the normal zone. Easy, is well, easy! Beginner is
an easy version of easy!

If you played SH1, Normal or Easy is the best way to start. If you never 
played SH1 at all, beginner is the way to go. Hard is for veterans on 
the go.

Here is a lowdown of the major modes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Enemies can take more shots.
-James trips once in a while (goof!)
-Enemies revive faster and move faster.
-James has low health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NORMAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Enemies can take some ammo.
-James rarely trips.
-Enemies don't revive often.
-James has fragile health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
EASY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Enemies can take little ammo.
-James never trips.
-Enemies never revive.
-James has great health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGINNER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Enemies can take VERY little ammo.
-James never trips.
-Enemies never revive.
-James has strong health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
RIDDLE MODES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
EASY RIDDLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the puzzles are MUCH easier to solve. The decisions are a
little more obvious with the files around and don't really involve any
thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NORMAL RIDDLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the puzzles are a little easier to solve. The decisions are a
little less obvious even with the files around and don't really involve
THAT MUCH thinking, though might be some behind it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARD RIDDLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the puzzles are much harder to solve. The decisions are not
very obvious even with the files around and they really involve THAT
MUCH thinking.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. MONSTER AND BOSS LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

===============
HEADLESS ZOMBIE
===============
Damage: Light
Recommended Weapon: Plank.
These are the most abundant monsters in the game. They take some plank
shots, but only a few Handgun Shots.

==============
FACELESS NURSE
==============
Damage: Medium
Recommended Weapon: Pipe.
These girls are abundant in the hospitals. They wield some melee
weapons and are somewhat dangerous. Hit them with the pipe or shoot
them with the Pistol.

===========
DOOR DEMONS
===========
Damage: Medium.
Recommended Weapon: Shotgun.
These guys appear at the end of the game. They deal some damage, so kill 
them with the Shotgun before they can deal any real damage. Health 
Drinks can cover their damage.

3 monsters only? Well, the rest are bosses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM

When you enter the room, you'll see Pyramid Head taking out his rage on  
a zombie.  James witnesses this and tries to flee, but the door locked 
behind him, so you'll have to fight.

Watch out for the GREAT KNIFE Pyramid has.  One overhead swing is enough 
to kill you, no matter how good your health is.  My favorite way to beat 
him is to stand near the door, then when Pyramid Head gets close and 
begins the overhead swing animation, I run to the corner diagonally 
across from the door, and repeat run past again during the overhead 
swing animation.  I keep repeating this while firing bullets until 
Pyramid Head goes away.  You'll know if you're hurting him when you hear 
a shot clank off of his helmet.

If you want to fight him with the PLANK instead, you can wait for him to 
do the motion that he's about to do an overhead swing, then run behind 
him and hit him in the back with the PLANK.  He won't stop in the middle 
of the swinging animation, so you'll be safe.  This is a lot trickier 
than doing it with the HANDGUN.

You'll know you've defeated Pyramid Head when you hear sirens in the 
distance.  When the sirens come on, Pyramid Head will walk down the 
stairs and into the water.  Get out of his way and he won't attack you.  
Also don't follow after him down the stairs or you might get killed.

Another away to defeat him, thanks to someone e-mailing CVXFREAK, is to 
evade Pyramid Head until you hear the sirens and he goes down the 
stairs.  Hurting him will make him go down the stairs sooner, though.  I 
recommend you evade him if you want to save your precious ammo.
======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
=====================
BOSS # 2: HANGING MEN
=====================
DIFFICULTY: Easy

This fight's pretty easy, especially compared to the fight with Pyramid 
Head back at the Blue Creek Apartment Building.  Just blast them with 
the SHOTGUN or the HANDGUN.  If you let them get close, they'll choke 
you with their feet, but it won't cause a lot of damage.  Keep track of 
your health and everything will be fine.

After you defeat three of them, the battle will end, and you'll hear 
those sirens again as James goes unconsious.  You'll get a scene of 
James being carted out of the hospital and into the GARDEN on a hospital 
bed.
=====================
BOSS # 2: HANGING MEN
=====================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================
DIFFICULTY: Medium
Pound this guy hard with SHOTGUN SHELLS.  After around 10+ hit's, it'll 
die.

It's one attack is very devestating.  It looks like the monster jumps on 
you then proceeds to chomp on your head.  This can kill you in three 
hits, so monitor your health carefully and heal after every two hits.  
The boss is fairly slow, and the SHOTGUN'S fast, so you should not have 
to worry much though.  Keep track of your ammo and don't get caught in a 
reloading animation.

The RIFLE may be stronger, but it's too slow.  The boss will be able to 
keep up with you between shots.
===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
Start shooting Eddie after he finishes talking.  Don't EVER let him 
shoot you.  One hit will take you down to bottom health.  Fortunately, 
it takes him awhile to draw his gun and fire a shot.

If you want to, you can beat him with the PIPE or the PLANK.  Be sure to 
trap him in a corner before doing this.  Usually, he'll punch you if you 
hit him with a blunt object.  Sometimes, he'll keep trying to draw his 
gun, but you can hit him hard during the slow aiming animation.  Every 
time he is hit, he'll have to start the animation over.

When he's hurt bad enough, he'll retreat to the next room.  Before you 
chase after him, gather up the SHOTGUN SHELLS and the RIFLE SHELLS.

MEAT LOCKER
Eddie will mouth off some more at James about being hated all his life, 
and brags about him killing that dog and the guy who came after him.  
When he stops talking, he'll come out of hiding and start attacking 
again.  This time, he'll take more damage.  Eddie has more room to move 
around, so you might be forced to use a gun this time.

The fight will then end with Eddie falling dead on the floor.  James is 
very sad due to the fact he actually killed another human being.  He is 
still wondering if Mary really did die three years ago.
===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================
DIFFICULTY: FAIRLY HARD
This is where your skills as a Silent Hill 2 gamer are tested. This
boss is like the one you faced in the Blue Creek Apartments- except
there are TWO of them!

Also, you MUST shoot them this time, instead of just dodge like in the
Blue Creek Apartments and at the labyrinth and hospital.

Load the Shotgun. It is faster than the Hunting Rifle, yet slightly
weaker than the Hunting Rifle. Which should you choose?

Like the battle with Eddie at the Labyrinth, quickness is more than
power. If you are slow, the Pyramid Heads will slash you up into
pieces.

If the shots are powerful, you can squeeze by with one shot before
running again. There are 2 different strategies here. One for the
Shotgun and one for the Rifle, since different gamers can utilize bth
weapons their own way.

================
SHOTGUN STRATEGY
================
Load the Shotgun. Get as far from either one as possible. Then start
firing. Fire 2 shots and move around them as they approach. They are
slightly slow, yet slightly fast.

Shoot them in a 2 shot pattern. You might get hit in the process- use a
Health Drink or Ampoule. The Ampoule will protect you from damage for
10 seconds- so this might be the time to equip the Rifle and fire off 5
powerful shots.

19-25 shots should kill them. Pyramid Head's gone now! YAY! Take THAT, 
punk! [That bastard who killed me twice!]

**************
RIFLE STRATEGY
**************
So you like the Rifle better? OK, that's fine. Load your rifle and run
to a corner, far from them. Fire one shot. If they are pretty far, shoot 
again and run. Run far from them, since they are medium distance in 
moving. Fire one shot or two shots, again. Run to the first corner you 
were in and repeat.

15-18 shots kill them at long last.

****************
HANDGUN STRATEGY
****************
This is the way I, Minesweeper, did it the first time.  Equip the 
HANDGUN, run to a corner of the room, count and fire three shots, run to 
the next corner, fire three shots, next corner, fire three shots, fourth 
corner, fire one shot and reload.  Repeat this pattern and after about 
100 bullets they'll die.  This takes a real long time to do though.
===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================
BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER
=======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
Compared to Eddie, she's a total wimp. Arm whatever you want.

So what should you arm? For the challenge, use the Handgun. For the mid
challenge, use the Shotgun. For the real challenge, use the Hunting
Rifle.

************
HANDGUN TIPS
************
For the Handgun, you must learn to run, shoot, run and shoot. If you
fought Pyramid Head with the Handgun at the Blue Creek Apartment
Building, you might know how to do it. Shoot, run, shoot, run is the 
strategy. Since the gun is quick, 3 shots can be fired before you must 
run again. Take advantage of the smallness and quickness of this gun. If 
the boss can never hit you, just pelting it with one bullet before 
running again can guarantee you a victory. I won't suggest this 
strategy, but merely if you want the challenge. It's harder than you 
believe!

**********
RIFLE TIPS
**********
The Rifle is the strongest and slowest weapon- major sacrifice! Shoot
one shot and run. If you're lucky, the bosses' flies won't hit you. Use 
the strategy from the Pyramid Head fight to beat this boss. I'll repeat 
it:

-----
So you like the Rifle better? OK, that's fine. Load your rifle and run
to a corner, far from them. Fire one shot. If they are pretty far, shoot 
again and run. Run far from them, since they are medium distance in 
moving. Fire one shot or two shots, again. Run to the first corner you 
were in and repeat.

15-18 shots kill them at long last.
-----

************
SHOTGUN TIPS
************
Use the strategy you used on Pyramid Head and Eddie to kill the boss. 
I'll repeat it:

-----
Load the Shotgun. Get as far from either one as possible. Then start
firing. Fire 2 shots and move around them as they approach. They are
slightly slow, yet slightly fast.

Shoot them in a 2 shot pattern. You might get hit in the process- use a

10 seconds- so this might be the time to equip the Rifle and fire off 5

19-25 shots should kill them. Pyramid Head's gone now! YAY! Take THAT, 
punk! [That bastard who killed me twice!]

One last shot once the boss is on the ground will kill this freak.
=======================
BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER
=======================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
9. RANKINGS
========================================================================

There are several strategies for getting the best rankings possible.
This is based off of my own experience. There may be varying ways to
acquire great scores. Your ending doesn't count, as far as I am
concerned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATHER ITEMS YOU SEE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, the item count counts for the ranking, as in the original Silent
Hill. Without taking too much time away, pick up ANYTHING you see.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPEED THROUGH THE GAME FAIRLY QUICKLY 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try to get a fast game. The fastest time results in a better ranking.
But try to grab all the items you may see. Good ways to speed through
the game is to avoid going through the item screen when unneeded. Skim
through files, because most of them just take time up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRY TO AVOID DAMAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless you want a certain ending, you want to keep yourself healthy in
order to help you get a faster speed ranking. Enough said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROTECT OR HURT MARIA
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want a certain ending, protect or don't protect Maria. Hit her
with the Wood Plank several times without killing her, or hang around
and wait for her while she is with you. You get a certain ending, but
the ending ranking will be fairly high.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVOID REPEATED AND UNNEEDED SAVING
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save when you have to. Try to vary your saves between sections of the
FAQ and save after something important has happened, such as a boss
fight or an FMV. Don't save if you saved 5 minutes ago or don't save if
you saved after a boss and only advanced by getting a new key. Saving
after puzzles is smart, but if you hated the puzzle, definitely save!
After playing the game several more times, saving should be very
minimal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAY ON THE HARDEST DIFFICULTY MODES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yup. Playing on Wimpy Modes warrants a lower ranking. Playing on Hard
Mode logically guarantees a good ranking. You should start by playing
Beginner and Hard Riddle Mode. The Riddles are not very hard in any
mode, so only the game play will throw you off. Work your way up to
Normal Mode (Easy Mode is Beginner Mode with a tad of difficulty. It is
a difference equivalent to that of a B+ and an A-.).

HAVE FUN
------------------------------------------------------------------------
While this isn't a real thing, the point of this game is to have fun.
While I didn't, others have and that hopefully will drive your 
motivation to getting that 10 Star Rank.

ARTCLE ABOUT MURDER INCIDENT
============================
The police announced today that Walter Sullivan, who was arrested on
the 18th of this month for the brutal murder of Billy Locane and his
sister, Miriam, committed suicide in his jail cell early in the morning
on the 22nd.

According to the Police Statement, Sullivan used a soup spoon to stab
himself in the neck, severing his carotid artery. By the time the guard
discovered him, Sullivan was dead from blood loss, the spoon buried 2
inches in his neck.

An old school mate of Walter Sullivan's from his hometown of Pleasant
River said "He didn't look like the type of guy to kill kids. But I do
remember that just before they arrested him he was blurting out all
sort of strange stuff like "He's trying to kill me. He's trying to
punish me. The monster... the red devil. Forgive me. I did it, but it
wasn't me!"

The school mate then added "I guess now that I think of it, he was
kinda crazy."

PATIENT RECORD
==============
[Jack Davis]
He has attempted suicide three times in the past for reasons unknown.
Although he is normally a model patient who follows doctor's and
nurse's orders, he must be watched closely due to his past pattern of
sudden and violent suicide attempts.

[Joseph Barkin]
His illness seems to be rooted in the fact that he believes he is
guilty of causing his daughter's death. His symptoms suggest a
psychotic break and paranoid delusions. Normally calm, but has a
tendency toward violence when excited.

DOCTOR'S JOURNAL
================
The potential for this illness
exists in all people and, under
the right circumstances, any
man or woman would be driven,
like him, to "the other side."
The "other side" perhaps may
not be the best way to phrase it.
After all there is no wall between
here and there. It lies on the
boarders where reality and unreality
intersects. it is a place both close
and distant.
Some say it isn't even an illness.
I cannot agree with them I'm a
doctor, not a philosopher or even
a psychiatrist.
But sometimes I have to ask
myself this question. It's true
that to us his imaginings are
nothing but the inventions of
a busy mind. But to him, there
simply is no other reality.
Furthermore he is happy there.
So why, I ask myself, why in the
name of healing him must we drag
him painfully into the world of our
own reality?
(Something else is written by hand.)
I got the key from Joseph.
It's probably the key to that box.

He who is not bold enough to be stared at from across the abyss is not

marching forward. Follow the map. There's a letter and a wrench.
*The key is in the park*(porch)
Or perhaps you are a fool. The truth usually betrays people. A part of
that abyss is in the old society. The key to the society is in the
park. At the foot of the praying woman, inside of the ground, inside of
a box. To open it, I need a wrench. My patient buried it there. I knew,
but I did nothing. It made me uneasy to have such a thing near. I
wasn't looking for the truth, I was looking for tranquility. I also saw
that thing. I fled, but the museum was sealed as well. Now no one dares
to approach that place. If you still do not wish to stop, James, I pray
to the Lord to have mercy on your eternal soul.

*Legend of the Lake*(prison)

Toluca Lake, the town's main tourist attraction. This clear, beautiful
lake has another side as well. It may seem like just a typical ghost
story that you might find in any number of old towns across the
country. But in this case, the legend is true. On a fog-bound November
day in 1918, the Little Baroness, a ship filled with tourists, failed
to return to port. A newspaper article from back then simply says, "It
most likely sunk for some reason." Despite an extensive police search,
not a single fragment of the ship nor any of the 14 bodies of
passengers or crew has ever been recovered to this day. In 1939, an
even stranger incident occurred.
-There are many pages torn out-
Many corpses rest at the bottom of this lake. Their bony hands reach up
towards the boats that pass overhead. Perhaps they reach for their
comrades.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Prison guard's diary*(found in prison)

Prisoner's do not feel remorse. In fact, they do not feel themselves to
be villans at all. Even the most uneducated brute will use what little
words he knows to justify himself. In such trifling dreams they have,
flourishing even in the darkness. Prisoners, too, are no exceptions. No
matter how foul nor loathsome one's own life and existence may be,
human nature is abiding.

13. CVXFREAK'S Review
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

SIMPLY NOT MY TYPE OF SURVIVAL HORROR

In January 1999, Konami released its game called Silent Hill. It was to
compete with Capcom's Resident Evil series and to be truthful, it held
its own against the masterpiece, Resident Evil 2. It was a wonderful
game, but Silent Hill 2 just doesn't touch the masterpiece games I got
to know in Resident Evil 2, Silent Hill 1 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.
Silent Hill 2, to me now, is repetative, unoriginal and plain boring.

Furthermore, I would like to add that I have been personally flamed and
attacked for this review. But it simply makes my opinion stronger about
this game and hopefully those narrowminded folks will realize that
someday, they'll learn to take other opinions kindly.

I am fixing several review areas to make it more understandable. But in
layman's terms, I now prefer many other games over this one. Got a
problem? Suck it up.

Graphics: 7
The graphics are grainy for a 128-bit game. But it is the PS2's limits,
if you know the hardware facts and believe me, they may surprise you.
But they are crisp and the game is quite large in areas, especially the
city. There is detail. Very exceptional, though CODE: Veronica looks a
tad better, though CVX is dated. The graphics are kinda grainy, but
Silent Hill is ALWAYS like that, though there are only 2 games.

Not exactly the worst thing EVER, but I preferred the non-grainyness of
the game. We can turn it off, but it simply looks washed out to my
eyes. Games like Devil May Cry have my type of graphical preference.
Other's opinions, of course, always vary.

Sound: 7
Well, SH1 had scarier sound. The sound here gets repetative, and non
scary, except for a few parts. Some scores, like the Angela/James
meeting at the start, could have been made a little better. SH1 had a
great soundtrack, while Silent Hill 2 comes a distant second.

Sure, the sound is what some others will call scary, but they are
basically reworked sounds from Silent Hill 1. I've been through them,
so I was used to them. Others, again, may differ. Please remember that.

Gameplay: 2
The entire game consists of running in the streets. Then you enter a
building to get to another section of the street. In the building are
rooms with keys to get through other locked doors to get keys for other
locked gates on the other floor. Repetative? You betcha! There are 2
apartment buildings, a hotel and a hospital. They are all too
repetative. They offer nothing new with getting around in these types
of games, which angers me. At first it seems really cool, but now it's
bland, washed out and overused.

Everyone says SH beats Resident Evil. I am a RE freak, so to speak and
I know survival horror. All the RE games to date (Except RE1 and
Survivor) have been great and story intriguing and surpass SH2 (not
necessarily SH1).

Story: 7
James Sunderland has no wife. His wife died 3 years ago. Now he gets a
letter from her telling him to go to Silent Hill. Mary, his wife, is
nowhere to be found. A girl named Angela and Eddie are found and Maria,
a carbon copy of Mary, is found. I won't spoil anything, because the
story is what sets this apart from BioHazard/Resident Evil.

The story is average, because the events are simply too convenient.
Maria... gets hurt and then comes back! HOW?!?!?! Konami tries to blow
if off with amnesia, but it shouldn't work that way. In RECVX, a dead
man came back to life for a real reason (something that is almost
expected in RE type survival horror). In this game, she miraculously
returns.

Again, inferences factor in, but I'm not a fan of them. This review is
my opinion. Remember that.

Control: 9
They are different from Silent Hill 1, which frustrates me. The
controls for the item screen are slightly dull, but not bad. Resident
Evil 3: Nemesis for PSX had better controls. While they are less
advanced in SH2, it doesn't affect gameplay much.

Overall, the control is a bit dull, again, but it isn't like the
controls in Resident Evil: Director's Cut.

Rent or Buy?
If you like Survival Horror, buy the game. But you may not be a big fan
of what the game offers, in comparison to the first game or even the
new Devil May Cry. If you are new to the series, rest, though if you
like it, you may want to try Resident Evil 2 or Silent Hill 1 for
beginners.

OVERALL: 4
It lushes in many aspects, yet dies in gameplay and a little in story.
While every other aspect is in the 7 range, gameplay, story and even
graphics are important and those are just outdated against RE3:
Nemesis, which offered conspiracy, action, scares (When you hear
Nemesis' voice, it is random, which makes it scary).

Silent Hill 2 is OK, closer to bad than good. I wish they learned to
make gameplay important, too, not just story.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.	SPOILER FREE WALKTHROUGH
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

=============
ENTERING TOWN
=============

After the scenes, head west from the bathroom. In the car, grab the
Silent Hill Map.

[NOTE: For the course of the game, maps will be VERY important. Use it
when navigating. When I say "head into Sanders Street", use the map to
get to it.]

Head down a flight of stairs and head across a path. You should see a
gate nearby. Head through.

Inside the graveyard, you'll see a cut-scene. Exit through the gate to
the west. Follow the path and you'll be on a road. That road is Sanders
Street.

Head to Lindsay Street to find blood. Head north on Vachss. There are
some Health Drinks on the right side of the street. Grab them... you'll
need them, especially on hard mode!

Follow Vachss Road. There's a lawn nearby with the first SAVE POINT of
the game. Instead of the notepad from SH1, you get some red slab. There
are 2 health drinks nearby... you'll need them.

Continue on Vachss Street. At the end is a wooden block in. Climb
through and you'll encounter your first monster. Inside, a scene
happens. James gets his first weapon... a Wooden Plank! It is effective
close-up.

Strike the monster and finish it off. The Plank is effective, since the
Handgun isn't coming your way for a while. You also get the Radio,
which sounds when monsters are nearby. Head back to Lindsay Street.
From there, find your way to Saul Street and then to the very top of
Martin Street.

[NOTE: You can find a trailer at the west end of Saul Street, pointing
to the top of Martin Street... it's probably useless, but it has a save
point.]

Monsters now roam the streets... dodge them since you have a lot of
space. On the top is a corpse. On it is a key. It is the Apartment Gate
Key. Look at the map to find "WOODSIDE APARTMENTS." To get there, head
west on Katz. The gate is nearby. Use the Key you just found to get in.

Head to the nearby door. You are in the Woodside Apartment Building. It
is MUCH like the Midwich School from the first game.

===================
WOODSIDE APARTMENTS
===================

Inside the building, grab the Map of Woodside. You'll need it! Grab the
Health Drink and save. You can't see the map yet because you need a
flashlight. Head up the nearby stairs.

Enter through the door to the second floor. Turn right and travel down
the hall passed 2 doors into room 205. Inside, explore the human decoy.
Grab the Flashlight and a monster attacks.

Hurt it with the Plank. Now that you can see the map, we need more
weapons, after that weird monster. While the Handgun isn't coming for a
while, we stock up on bullets.

Run to Room 210, using the map for guidance and killing monsters with
the Plank on your way there. Inside the rooms, grab the Handgun
Bullets. Now that we have decent stock, head to 3F. There, you'll see a
key across a gate.

A scene will cause you to get the key another way. Head to room 301 on
3F. Inside is the Handgun in a cart.

[NOTE: The Handgun runs out fast against all the monsters. You might
want to stick to the Plank, since we've been doing well with it. But if
you are a beginner and are playing on Hard Mode, stay equipped with the
Gun.]

Go to Room 208 now. Passed it is a gate with a monster. Beyond that
gate is something important- a door!

Inside 208, a man lies dead. On a shelf is Room 202 Key. Take it to
Room 202 on 2F. Inside, head to the kitchen for an important Health
Drink. A bedroom with some green stuff and bats has a Clock Key.

Take the Clock Key to Room 208 and head into the room near the dead
guy. Inside is a clock. Use the Clock Key on the face. Now use the D
PAD to turn the keys of the clock.

Keep turning it until you hear a click. When it clicked while I was
playing, it was a 9:10. It may be random, depending on the riddle
difficulty you chose at the start of the game.

Now go to the side and try to push the clock. Examine the clock like
you would any item and select "yes" when pushing it. It reveals a hole
in the wall leading to another apartment. Head out this apartment and
save.

Outside the room, you are on the other side of the gate near the door
leading to Room 208. Head through the door to another flight of stairs.
Climb it to 3F.

Examine the Map to find out that you can now get to the other side of
that gate where that girl kicked the key. Run there. Grab the Fire
Escape Key. Head into Room 307. After a scene, grab the Courtyard Key
in the closet and exit.

Head to the stairs on the east, noted on the map. Head down to the
bottom of the stairs to 1F. The door nearby leads to Canned Juice. Grab
it. Head back up to 2F by taking the stairs you just went down on.

Head up to 3F, down the north stairs, through Room 209, through the
room with the clock and dead man and to the laundry area by the stairs
you first used to get to 2F.

There is a garbage tunnel there. After about 10 minutes of figuring,
the realized the heavy thing you needed to drop into there was the
Canned Juice you found.

Now I ponder... where do we go next? Outside. This took me an hour to
find, but outside, near the gate you first entered from, is a garbage
dump. Examine it to get an Old Man Coin.

Head inside again and to the locked door at the foot of the stairs. Use
the Courtyard Key and head out. In this pool area, run down into it and
shoot the monsters. Head to the cart in the middle and grab the Snake
Coin.

Now head to the other door in this courtyard. It is near the one you
used to get to this building. Head into Room 101. Inside, is a scene.
After the scene (It never occurred to me that we had to explore that
area, so we couldn't move ahead), leave.

Head back through the courtyard and climb to 2F. Head to the left side
of the lobby and use the Fire Escape Key to head through. You arrive at
another building... another damn apartment building!

=====================
BLUE CREEK APARTMENTS
=====================

We are in another apartment building, but this one is shorter than
Woodside. We are in a bedroom. Run out into the bathroom. AndyRose2000
told me to check in the toilet for a combination.

Check it and you get a combination. It might be random. Jot it down,
along with arrows' direction. Head into the main area o the same room
and you will find a safe.

Use the combination from the toilet. When going to a new number, turn
the dial in the direction of the arrow after the previous number.
Inside are 4 Handgun Bullets. Thanks to AndyRose2000 for this extremely
helpful tip.

Now we need to head out. Arm the Plank for now. Head out. Outside, find
a door under an exit sign. It is a stairway and to James' right is the
Blue Creek Map.

Use it to follow my next directions. To get back to Woodside
Apartments, use Room 203, as hinted in the map. But we don't need to
bother with that place anymore, but if you want to ever get back to the
areas at the start, that's the path you use.

If you want to save, head to Room 105, on the first floor. For another
dose of ammo, head to Room 109. Head through the white door in that
room and you'll see a scene.

You know have a knife. But it isn't a weapon! I've tried!

[NOTE: Rumor has it that examining the Knife may affect the game's
ending. I can guess that if you examine the Knife in the item screen, a
new ending occurs. I will have to try this out.]

Collect the coin nearby. It is the Prisoner Coin. Like the Snake and
Old Man Coins you found at Woodside, we are going to need this for a
puzzle coming up.

Head to Room 105. Look at the little drawer with the 5 circles. The
coins you found are needed for it. Since I'm playing on all 3 Riddle
Modes, here are my solutions.

For the HARD Mode, insert the Old Man in the second slot. Put the Snake
in the fourth slot and the Prisoner in the last slot.

For the NORMAL Mode, insert the Old Man in the second slot. Put the
Prisoner in the middle slot and the Snake in the last slot.

For the EASY Mode, insert the Old Man in the first slot. Insert the
Snake in the middle slot and the Prisoner in the last slot.

The drawer should open, revealing a key called the Lyne House Key. A
person named Lyne probably owned this place. The Lyne House Key fits
into Room 209, so head there on 2F.

Inside, you'll hear someone whisper. But I couldn't hear what he said.
If anyone heard, please e-mail me!

Anyway, head to Room 208 via the balcony. Inside 208, there is a Save
Point. SAVE!!! Then grab the Apartment Stairway Key and the Bullets-
you'll need the bullets for your first boss fight!

Travel to the north stairs on 2F. Travel across the balcony again to
209 and turn left to the stairs in the northern area. The Key you got
should work there. Remember to SAVE!!!

Head down to a boss fight! This is fairly hard, so arm the Handgun and
have at least 45 Handgun Bullets.

======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
This is probably the monster President Evil called "Pyramid Head" in
his analysis of SH2. Now it's after us! Arm the Handgun and get as far
as possible from Pyramid Head. Start shooting it. On Normal and Hard
Modes, reload your gun in the menu because James can get hit doing it
manually. Believe me, I know!

Keep shooting and running passed it. It hits pretty hard. That Knife is
the best weapon James can find later and if it is stronger than even
the Handgun, imagine the damage it can inflict on James.

Although it seems P. Head isn't getting hurt, it is. Just listen to the
clank of the bullets. P. Head will eventually go down the stairs. DON'T
FOLLOW! I followed him and I got killed.

The water will drain and you can now exit the damn place. Exit and you
are back outside, on the other side of the blocked area near Woodside
Apartments.

Another away to defeat him, thanks to someone e-mailing me, which I
will post his name soon, is to just dodge him until he leaves the room
down the stairs. Some people say it is impossible to hurt him, and it
is. BUT the shots make it faster for him to surrender.
======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================

=======================================
ROSEWATER PARK AND PATH TO THE HOSPITAL
=======================================

We need to get to the park James wanted to go to at the start of the
game. Run to Rosewater Park. Use the Map to get there. On your way,
you'll see a scene.

After she leaves, proceed to Rosewater. Run through the park until you
see a scene. Maria will accompany you for now on. According a few
people, what you do with her affects the game.

Now look for "Pete's Bowl-A-Rama." Head inside. Turn to the door to the
left and you'll see a scene.

[Note: if you continue toward the north part of the lake, where SH1
took place, the place will be blocked and a corpse will be there to
tell you to go to Pete's Bowling Alley. I directed you to go there
directly to avoid a long walk.]

Leave the place for now. See a scene and head down the side of Pete's.
Turn right and you'll see a gate. Head through and turn left. After a
scene with Laura, try opening the nearby door.

After another scene, head through the door and up the stairs to the
right. Look for the tiled door and head through to a night club room.
Head out and turn right. Go to the hospital. Head inside.

===================
BROOKHAVEN HOSPITAL
===================

Hospitals... brings back [UN]lovely memories, especially in SH1 and RE3.
To the left is a Hospital Map- you'll need it like all the maps thus
far. If you want to save, there's a red slab in the Reception Office.

Head to the Document Room, via the Reception Room. There's a Purple
Bull Key by the typewriter. Read the journal nearby, too. Using the
map, find the staircase so we can go to Floor 2. Head inside the
Women's Locker Room. Examine the bear for a Bent Needle. The Shotgun is
in the nearby locker.

Head inside the Men's Locker Room. Inside the Exam Room Key. Go back
downstairs and unlock the Examination Room. Head to the Doctor's Lounge
for very important Shotgun Shells.

Travel to 2F again. Head into Exam Room 3. Grab the First Aid Kit.
Check the typewriter for a VERY, VERY important code. JOT IT DOWN ON
PAPER, because it is random!

Head into the room called M2 and grab the Lapis Eye Key. The Shotgun
Shells nearby are a needed item for the boss at the end of this
section.

Head into M3 for Handgun Bullets and a Health Drink. M6 has Shotgun
Shells and a Health Drink. Head to Floor 3.

Go to the door leading to the hallway with the "S" Rooms. You need a
code. That code is 7335 on Easy and Normal Riddle Modes and 1328 on
Hard. To find this out, read a memo in the First Floor Exam Room.

Head to Room S3. Maria will leave James' side. There's a key nearby.
Grab the Roof Key. Head over to the roof, via the staircase. Use the
Roof Key to unlock it.

On top is a diary. Read it if you want.

[NOTE: I hear the if you read the diary, you get a certain ending. I
have not confirmed this, but it seems very likely. Stand around it if
you don't want to hear it. Stand for a few moments and then try heading
out.]

As you head back in, something will be blocking the door. Pyramid Head,
from the Blue Creek Apartments, has returned. After a scene, you'll be
back on the third floor, in the Special Treatment Room.

Down there, head through the door left of the sign. Inside, read the
blood-spattered wall. Try to figure out the code. JOT IT DOWN ON THE
SAME PAPER AS THE CODE FROM EARLIER!

Head to Floor 2 and check on Maria. Then head to the last door in that
hall- S14. Inside, is a box that needs 2 codes and 2 keys to open. Use
the Lapis Eye Key and Purple Bull Keys to remove the chains. Now enter
the code you got from the typewriter on the right padlock.

Enter the code you got from the bloody wall on the left and open the
case for... HAIR!!! Ew...

Anyway, this took me a damn half-hour to figure out, so I had to refer
to the BradyGames Guide for this one! Thanks to BradyGames for the tip!
Go to the Shower Room and look at the green slimed faucet. Go to the
item screen and combine the hair from the bear with the bent needle.

To combine, select the hair and then use the "combine." Now select the
bent needle and select "use." You should get an elevator key. Use it on
the elevator on Floor 3F.

Ride it to Floor 1. Head into Room C3 and see a scene. After a few
scenes, you are in your second boss battle. Arm the Shotgun!

====================
BOSS # 2: MONKEY MEN
====================
DIFFICULTY: Easy
I call them monkey men because they hang on ceilings. Aim your Shotgun
up and fire a shot from the Shotgun. There are 2 of them, so keep
moving and strafing.

They can damage, but not VERY much. They'll give you the occasional
hit, but it won't be anything a Health Drink can't heal. But be
careful... as in all survival horror games, damage adds up (I've died
countless times against crows in BioHazard 2!).

Keep firing that Shotgun and it'll be your best friend. The Handgun is
also effective if you run out of Shotgun Bullets.

After the scenes, we arrive in the Evil Brookhaven Hospital!
====================
BOSS # 2: MONKEY MEN
====================

========================
EVIL BROOKHAVEN HOSPITAL
========================

We are back in the Garden, but now it is EVIL, like the Midwich School
from SH1. Move through the double doors. Save and grab the Shotgun
Shells.

[XBOX players: If you have the BLUE GEM, use it right now if you have 
it.]

Search Room C2 for a First Aid Kit, which you will definitely need.
Head to the elevator. Ride it to Floor 2, 2F. There are nurses and
Shotgun Shells on M4.

Head into M6 and grab the Dry Cell Battery and the Basement Storeroom
Key.

[NOTE: Grab the Dry Cell Battery! Your Flashlight will run out in the
next sections, and the Dry Cell Battery will refill it!]

They are located near some strange color symbol. Grab the memo nearby.
There are also Handgun Bullets and a First Aid Spray in there.

Return to the elevator and go to 3F. When you emerge, there is a weird
door nearby. It needs 2 rings. Didn't the file from the last room talk
about a ring?

Head to S11 and grab the Handgun Bullets and the AMPOULE! This makes
Harry go to green health AND makes him invincible for about 20 seconds!
Read the memo nearby.

Head to the stairs on 3F by the Storeroom. Descend all the way to the
basement level and use the Basement Storeroom Key to open it. Inside,
push the shelf nearby. After a scene, climb down the ladder and grab
the Copper Ring.

Travel back to 3F. Head down the elevator to 2F. A radio show message
comes from James' Radio, the one he found in the Construction Site when
that monster first attacked him. Read it closely.

Travel to the Day Room on 2F. Open the refrigerator with Maria's help
to get the Lead Ring. This next section is optional. Otherwise, travel
to the strange door by the elevator on 3F.

******************
TRICK OR TREAT BOX
******************

Here is the sequence box.

     1 2 3
01: O O O
02: O O O
03: O O O

OK. Now we need to press the right buttons. If you remember from the
elevator message, you need the right answers. Well, on the "01" Row,
press button 3. Press button 1 on the "02" Row. On the "03" Row, press
the 3 button.

The box should open, revealing 5 Boxes of Shotgun Shells and 2
Ampoules! Worth the deviating trip!

**********************
END TRICK OR TREAT BOX
**********************

Now we are back on track. Head to the weird door by 3F's working
elevator. Use the Copper and Lead Rings. Head through the door and down
the stairs.

Down there, there is a long tunnel. Pyramid Head seems to have survived
your battle from Blue Creek Apartments, so we need to run! Run down the
tunnel as fast as you can. Keep running.

If Maria is murdered, the game ends. Keep running until you're at an
elevator. After a sad scene, James is at the other section of 1F. Don't
be too sad, though.

Head into the Director's Room and grab the Hospital Key. Check the map,
too. Now we could head out. Exit through the way you came in after
seeing a scene.

===========================
DARK SOUTH VALE SILENT HILL
===========================

Head south on Carroll Street. The travel east on Rendell. Head south on
Monson. There are many items on the ground- search for many of them!
Head back to Saul Street.

Cross the gate. Now run to the trailer you may have gone to before and
save there. Now go to Neely's Bar for an important file. Look on the
window, passed the comment you saw at the beginning of the game.

Head to "Gonzale's Mexican Restaurant" on East South Vale Silent Hill.
Head there by going north on Neely's Street, and East on Sanders. Head
north Lindsay and grab the Wrench and memo.

Now we need to get back to Rosewater Park where we first saw Maria.
Either retrace your steps to the hospital and head through the Heaven's
Night Bar and run to the park, or head west on Katz, through the gate,
near the Woodside Apartments and Blue Creek Apartments you explored at
the start of the game. Continue for Rosewater Park.

Head through the left entrance of the park and find the statue of a
praying woman. Behind the face of it, look for a brown spot and dig
there. There is a box in which you will use the Wrench for.

Now grab the Old Bronze Key. Head to the Silent Hill Historical
Society. Head there, which is west of the Rosewater Park. Enter through
the door in the parking lot. Use the Silent Hill Map from the truck in
the start of the game to get there.

==============================
SILENT HILL HISTORICAL SOCIETY
==============================

Head into the only open door in this room. Head through the hole in the
wall. Keep going down for about 3 minutes until you reach a door.
Through it, take the FAK (First Aid Kit). Move to the nearest door for
Handgun Bullets. Now head to the far door to continue.

There is a hole in this room. Jump down. You end up in a well. Arm the
Steel Pipe you found at Texxon Gas Station. Examine every inch of the
wall until you find a message saying some of the wall is weaker.

When you find that part of the wall, hit it with the Steel Pipe to find
a door. Head through are you are in a new section of the sewers from
the first Silent Hill. Head to your right to find a blocked door. But
near it is another door to head through.

At the end of the next room is a hole in the ground. We need to open
the hole first. Head through the nearby door. Grab the Spiral-Writing
Key.

Now the room is filled with Roaches and your Flashlight goes out. The
Dry Cell Battery you found way back in the Evil Hospital. Suddenly, the
door is locked. Head to the nearby panel.

We need to unlock it. Check to see the lighted buttons. This will
change, depending on your difficulty level. But you must only press the
lighted buttons.

Try out all combinations. Eventually, you'll get the code to get out.
Head to the bars to the right. Use the Spiral Writing Key. Jump down
the hole (again).

=============
TOLUCA PRISON
=============

We are in a prison beneath the Historical Society. Run to the nearest
door. Inside is a scene. After the scene, check the room for some
items, including a Pig Tablet.

Head out and turn left... all the way to the table. There is a map 
there.
Take it! This place can be confusing!

Head down to the door to the right. Head into the shower and grab the
Seductress Tablet. Use the map to get to the bottom hall of the Toluca
Prison.

In the bottom hall, head to the only open cellblock for a Wax Doll.
Head to the right hall of the Prison now. Head north. Head north to the
middle doors of this hall and enter the one to the left. There are VERY
important Rifle Shells, since we are getting the most powerful gun, the
Hunting Rifle!

Head to the northern hallway. To your right, head to the seventh cell
block to find the Oppressor Tablet. We have 3 tablets... head to the 
very
large room of this complex.

In this yard is an hanging platform with 3 square engravings. Place all
3 Tablets into it and you'll hear a dying man scream. Nothing happens!
Argh!

Head back through the door you came from... there's a Horseshoe on the
door! Grab it! Head to the west corridor. The best way would be to
cross the northern hallway back to the west hallway, to unlock some
doors.

Head to the very top left door of the west hall. Head through this
visiting room to the other door. On this new corridor, head to the
lowest right room of this hall to get a Lighter.

Outside in the hallway, there is a sewer hole. Before opening it, you
might want to save in the Boy's Bathroom, nearby. Before going, check
on of the doors on the left side of this hallway. Use the map for
reference. Inside is the... HUNTING RIFLE!

[NOTE: The Hunting Rifle is a tad stronger than the Shotgun, but a
little slower. This weapon is only recommended for groups of monsters
and single Pyramid Heads if you run into one (which will be very soon,
actually). The Shotgun is preferred for the last 2 bosses.]

Head back to the sewer hole. Got to the COMBINE option and use it on
the Wax Doll. Then select the lighter and use COMBINE again. Then use
the Horseshoe and the sewer door should open. Thanks to BradyGames'
guide for this tip (since I couldn't figure this one out either:).

We aren't out of the prison yet, though. We are in the basement. Head
through the only open door. Head through the next rooms until you reach
a hole (AGAIN! James' feet will eventually get CRUSHED!).

Head into the nearby elevator. Ride it to another room and save,
because there is a VERY confusing level next.

=========
LABYRINTH
=========

I call this place the labyrinth because it is a Greek word for "maze"
and believe me, it's more than just a maze! It is also something that
constructs itself... if you refer to the map, the maze is building as
James moves!

Across from the doorway is a ladder that is blocked. Turn left and find
a fork in the maze. You should see a nearby ladder you can climb down-
climb down.

Pyramid Head is here, so if you want to fight, use the Rifle to scare
it away. Circle the room until you feel you have made a circle and look
at the map. The red shows you've been through that door, so you should
head through the other one.

Head through. Inside is the Great Knife! It's the Knife that Pyramid
Head used when you fought him in the Blue Creek Apartments and when
Maria was stabbed.

Grab it and 2 ammo boxes. The Great Knife is stronger than the Steel
Pipe and Wooden Plank, but a little slower. Head back through the
ladder you came from. Using the map you have, head "DOWN" to where a
hole has been made.

Head down. Now is the time to use that Great Knife.

************
BLOCK PUZZLE
************
Head through the tunnels until you see a block with faces. Here is MY
solution, though it may be random, depending on the difficulty level.
The cube needs to have red eyes facing right side up. Turn the cube
until you see an upside down face with green eyes.

The exit will now be open. A scene will happen. Head back to the room
with that cube.

There is a wire cutter now. OK. Fight your way to the very start of the
level, where you entered from the Toluca Prison. Remember the blocked
ladder?

Cut it with the Wire Cutter and head down the ladder. Head to the first
ladder in a tunnel leading right. Climb that ladder. Follow the next
few tunnels. There are some dead ends, but they only cause a 10-second
devitation. The exits of the tunnels should eventually find you.

Climb a few ladders and turn left, since Pyramid Head is nearby. Climb
the ladders. Equip the Shotgun now. A boss is coming up!

Head down the hallway.

===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================
DIFFICULTY: Medium
Pop this thing with the Shotgun. Run around this relatively slow boss
and pump this thing full of Shells. After 10+ shells, the boss should
die.

This thing can have a devastating attack if it hits you. It smashes you
and can cut your health down pretty low. Be careful, because 3 hits can
spell James' doom. But don't worry. The relatively quick Shotgun and
the slow boss are a good fit, especially with the Shotgun's sheer
power.

The Hunting Rifle is also effective. But it is relatively slower and
got me killed. DON'T USE IT! You can barely move with it AND it fires
slower than the Shotgun. This can be your biggest blunder, so be VERY,
VERY careful!
===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================

After killing this bastard, a scene happens. Head out after the scene.
Head to the first door you see. Read the inscriptions on the bodies. I
figured out this puzzle.

EASY MODE: The Kidnapper is innocent.

NORMAL MODE: The Arsonist is innocent.

HARD: The Counterfeiter is innocent.

Remember their positions in this room!

Head to the next door to the left you see. Inside, depending on your
mode, pull the rope that had the inscription of the guy in the previous
room. If you read the papers of the hanged men, you'll see you're in a
similar room.

Pull the rope that had the innocent man and head back to the room with
the bodies. The Persecuted Key is there. Grab it and head through the
only door you haven't been through in the hall outside. Proceed and you
end up in Maria's Cell. After a scene, leave/

Head through the gate. You are in a weird graveyard. Save, grab 3
Shotgun Shell boxes and head down the grave hole. Make sure you have
the RIFLE equipped.

Down the hole, you must fight yet another boss.

===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
After Eddie stops talking, hit Eddie with the Hunting Rifle twice. One
hit from his gun with take you down to the bottom health, so heal with
a First Aid Spray or Ampoule.

After 3-5 Rifle hits, Eddie heads into the next room. At this time,
equip the Shotgun because Eddie will take a few more hits. Follow him
and then start shooting after he shuts the hell up. Run around him and
fire the Shotgun.

Eddie's Pistol can kill James in even just 2 hits. Always use a Health
Drink when shot.

Run around Eddie. Fire the Shotgun several more times. Eddie will
eventually fall. Unlike the fight with Cybil from Silent Hill 1, Eddie
can't be saved.
===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============

After Eddie dies, exit this weird place. We are out of the Labyrinth!

==============
BOAT ADVENTURE
==============
James ends up in an area behind the Silent Hill Historical Society he
explored just a few minutes ago. Now that we are out of that damn
strange level, we still have to get to the Hotel over by the northern
area of the lake (By the area where SH1 took place). Its also day time,
again, which is good.

Save and head down the pier. 

[XBOX players: If you have the BLUE GEM, use it right now if you have 
it.]

There is a boat you have to row. On Easy and Normal Mode, head toward 
the light by simply pressing the D-Pad. Turn right when you get on and 
run toward the light.

On Hard mode, you must use the twin sticks. OK. Start by rotating both
sticks right. You should see the light. Now turn the left stick left
and the right stick right, both at the same time.

You should reach the light in no time. You are now in the hotel.

===============
LAVE VIEW HOTEL
===============
Climb the stairs and turn left. Look on a fountain for a Little Mermaid
Box. Grab it and enter the Hotel.

Inside, turn left to get the Hotel Map. Use it to navigate through for
the rest of the game. Enter the Lake Shore Restaurant. Investigate the
piano and you get a Letter.

Find a table and gather the Fish Key. There are Door Monsters, but they
are smaller than the one you saw at the Labyrinth. The Great Knife can
do damage. Look for the small set of stairs behind a nearby door. Head
down the B1F. Look for the Venus Tears Bar. It's locked. But in the
nearby elevator, is a Thinner Can. Head up to 1F and to the lobby.

Inside, insert the Little Mermaid Music Box in the center stand, on the
left slot. Save and head through the door left off the check in desk.

Grab the Room 312 Key.

Head up the staircase and turn right through the door. Search the Cloak
Room. There is a briefcase you should open with the Fish Key. Grab the
Room 204 Key. Grab all the other supplies. Head to Room 204. Unlock it
and look for an Employee Elevator Key. Head through the hole in the
room to the next apartment room.

There are photos- use the Thinner to get a code. Use it on the nearby
safe. The Cinderella Box is inside, like the Little Mermaid Box from
the fountain outside. Head to the staircase and then through the other
door.

Head through the white door with the Employee Elevator Key. Inside,
save and there is a SAVE POINT. Near the elevator is a cabinet. You
MUST store all your items. EVERY LAST ONE.

Head to 1F on the elevator. Ride down and grab another map of the
hotel, displaying some employee areas. Go to the Pantry Room and
collect the Cinderella Box from the shelves.

Enter the Office nearby and grab the Video Tape and Can Opener. Find
the staircase and head down to B1F. Head to the Boiler Room, avoiding
any monsters.

Inside, look to your right and grab a key hanging from a rope. Head to
the Kitchen now. Inside is a can. Use the Can Opener and grab a Light
Bulb.

Head through the other door in the kitchen to the Venus Tears Bar. On
the bar, near the jukebox, use a Light Bulb on the lamp and exit the
room using the Bar Key. You are now back in the hall where you found
the Thinner.

Head back up to the lobby and head to the center-piece where you left
the Little Mermaid box. Place the Cinderella Box inside, but we need
the last one- it's in the cabinet near the employee elevator.

Run back there, gather all your items and head back here. Place the
Snow White Box inside. There may be different combinations, so place
them all in whatever order. You should get the Hotel Stairway Key. Head
to the 2F stairs.

On the 3F level, unlock the gate to 3F. Head to Room 312 at last.

[XBOX players: If you have the BLUE GEM, use it right now if you have 
it. You'll end up with a new ending.]

Inside, view the video tape and see a scene. Afterwards, exit the room.

Afterwards... some things will have changed...

====================
EVIL LAKE VIEW HOTEL
====================
Now travel to the Reading Room on 2F. Listen to the headphones.

[After playing more than once, the headphones have been determined to
get you an ending. When I viewed it, I got both the In Water ending and
Leave ending. It depends on your other actions.]

Head to the elevator (the one NOT used by staff). Head to Room 202 to
get warped outside Room 19. From there, run to the elevator. Ride it to
B1F.

Enter the Venus Tears Bar. In the back of the bar, grab 5 Health
Drinks. Run to the kitchen. There are Shotgun and Rifle Shells. You'll
need the Shotgun Shells, trust me!

Head to the Employee Stairs. After the scene, exit. When you exit, you
aren't in the previous room anymore- you're at the top of the employee
stairs! Weird...

Head to 1F. The Manager's Office has some Rifle Shells you may need.
Head through the other door that's unlocked. Run down the hall,
avoiding the monsters underneath.

At the end are 9 total SAVE POINTs. SAVE! SAVE!! SAVE!!! Load the
Shotgun, since you know have to fight a boss in the lobby.

===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================
DIFFICULTY: FAIRLY HARD
This is where your skills as a Silent Hill 2 gamer are tested. This
boss is like the one you faced in the Blue Creek Apartments- except
there are TWO of them!

Also, you MUST shoot them this time, instead of just dodge like in the
Blue Creek Apartments and at the labyrinth and hospital.

Load the Shotgun. It is faster than the Hunting Rifle, yet slightly
weaker than the Hunting Rifle. Which should you choose?

Like the battle with Eddie at the Labyrinth, quickness is more than
power. If you are slow, the Pyramid Heads will slash you up into
pieces.

If the shots are powerful, you can squeeze by with one shot before
running again. There are 2 different strategies here. One for the
Shotgun and one for the Rifle, since different gamers can utilize bth
weapons their own way.

================
SHOTGUN STRATEGY
================
Load the Shotgun. Get as far from either one as possible. Then start
firing. Fire 2 shots and move around them as they approach. They are
slightly slow, yet slightly fast.

Shoot them in a 2 shot pattern. You might get hit in the process- use a
Health Drink or Ampoule. The Ampoule will protect you from damage for
10 seconds- so this might be the time to equip the Rifle and fire off 5
powerful shots.

19-25 shots should kill them after they stab each other. Pyramid Head's
gone now! YAY! Take THAT, punk! [That bastard who killed me twice!]
================
SHOTGUN STRATEGY
================

**************
RIFLE STRATEGY
**************
So you like the Rifle better? OK, that's fine. Load your rifle and run
to a corner, far from them. Fire one shot. If they are pretty far,
shoot again and run.

Run far from them, since they are medium distance in moving. Fire one
shot or two shots, again. Run to the first corner you were in and
repeat.

15-18 shots kill them at long last.
===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================

Run to where the Pyramid Heads are and search them for Scarlet and
Rust-Colored Eggs. Head to the nearby doors. Insert the Scarlet Egg to
the right door and the Rust Colored Egg on the left door.

Head through one of the doors now- it doesn't matter which one.

Cross the hallway- if you listen as in stop running... you get a certain
ending. If you run through without stopping, you probably will get
another ending, based on my experience.

Head through the door at the end. At the other side, turn left and head
up the long stairs. You must fight a boss. Arm... whatever you want to
arm, because like the last boss, there are 2 strategies to use here.

=======================
BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER
=======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
Compared to Eddie, she's a total wimp. Arm whatever you want.

So what should you arm? For the challenge, use the Handgun. For the
middle challenge, use the Shotgun. For the real challenge, use the
Hunting Rifle.

============
HANDGUN TIPS
============
For the Handgun, you must learn to run, shoot, run and shoot. If you
fought Pyramid Head with the Handgun at the Blue Creek Apartment
Building, you might know how to do it.

Shoot, run, shoot, run is the strategy. Since the gun is quick, 3 shots
can be fired before you must run again. Take advantage of the smallness
and quickness of this gun. If the boss can never hit you, just pelting
it with one bullet before running again can guarantee you a victory.

I won't suggest this strategy, but merely if you want the challenge.
It's harder than you believe!

**********
RIFLE TIPS
**********
The Rifle is the strongest and slowest weapon- major sacrifice! Shoot
one shot and run. If you're lucky, the bosses' flies won't hit you.

Use the strategy from the Pyramid Head fight to beat this boss.

============
SHOTGUN TIPS
============
Use the strategy you used on pyramid Head and Eddie to kill the boss.

One last shot once the boss is on the ground will kill this freak.

15. Handgun/Melee Weapon Only Walkthrough
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================

=============
ENTERING TOWN
=============

After the scenes, head west from the bathroom. In the car, grab the
Silent Hill Map.

***REPLAY GAME: If this is your second time through the main game,
there should be a Blue Gem inside the Bathroom. Grab it if you want the
XBOX exclusive UFO Ending.

[NOTE: For the course of the game, maps will be VERY important. Use it
when navigating. When I say "head into Sanders Street", use the map to
get to it.]

Head down a flight of stairs and head across a path. You should see a
gate nearby. Head through.

Inside the graveyard, you'll see Angela. Talk to her and exit through
the gate to the west. Follow the path and you'll be on a road. That
road is Sanders Street.

Head to Lindsay Street to find blood. Head north on Vachss. There are
some Health Drinks on the right side of the street. Grab them... you'll
need them, especially on hard mode!

Follow Vachss Road. There's a lawn nearby with the first save point of
the game. Instead of the notepad from SH1, you get some red slab. There
are 2 health drinks nearby... you'll need them.

Continue on Vachss Street. At the end is a wooden block in. Climb
through and you'll encounter your first monster. Inside, a scene
happens. James gets his first weapon... a Wooden Plank! It is effective
close-up.

Strike the monster and finish it off. The Plank is effective, since the
Handgun isn't coming your way for a while. You also get the Radio,
which sounds when monsters are nearby. Head back to Lindsay Street.
From there, find your way to Saul Street and then to the very top of
Martin Street.

[NOTE: You can find a trailer at the west end of Saul Street, pointing
to the top of Martin Street... it's probably useless, but it has a save
point.]

Monsters now roam the streets... dodge them since you have a lot of
space. On the top is a corpse. On it is a key. It is the Apartment Gate
Key. Look at the map to find "WOODSIDE APARTMENTS." To get there, head
west on Katz. The gate is nearby. Use the Key you just found to get in.

Head to the nearby door. You are in the Woodside Apartment Building. It
is MUCH like the Midwich School from the first game.

===================
WOODSIDE APARTMENTS
===================

Inside the building, grab the Map of Woodside. You'll need it! Grab the
Health Drink and save. You can't see the map yet because you need a
flashlight. Head up the nearby stairs.

Enter through the door to the second floor. Turn right and travel down
the hall passed 2 doors into room 205. Inside, explore the human decoy.
Grab the Flashlight and a monster attacks.

Hurt it with the Plank. Now that you can see the map, we need more
weapons, after that weird monster. While the Handgun isn't coming for a
while, we stock up on bullets.

Run to Room 210, using the map for guidance and killing monsters with
the Plank on your way there. Inside the rooms, grab the Handgun
Bullets. Now that we have decent stock, head to 3F. There, you'll see a
key across a gate.

A girl will kick it away. Head to room 301 on 3F. Inside is the Handgun
in a cart.

[NOTE: The Handgun runs out fast against all the monsters. You might
want to stick to the Plank, since we've been doing good with it. But if
you are a beginner and are playing on Hard Mode, stay equipped with the
Gun.]

Go to Room 208 now. Passed it is a gate with a monster. Beyond that
gate is something important- a door!

Inside 208, a man lies dead. On a shelf is Room 202 Key. Take it to
Room 202 on 2F. Inside, head to the kitchen for an important Health
Drink. A bedroom with some green stuff and bats has a Clock Key.

Take the Clock Key to Room 208 and head into the room near the dead
guy. Inside is a clock. Use the Clock Key on the face. Now use the D
PAD to turn the keys of the clock.

Keep turning it until you hear a click. When it clicked while I was
playing, it was a 9:10. It may be random, depending on the riddle
difficulty you chose at the start of the game.

Now go to the side and try to push the clock. Examine the clock like
you would any item and select "yes" when pushing it. It reveals a hole
in the wall leading to another apartment. Head out this apartment and
save.

Outside the room, you are on the other side of the gate near the door
leading to Room 208. Head through the door to another flight of stairs.
Climb it to 3F.

Examine the Map to find out that you can now get to the other side of
that gate where that girl kicked the key. Run there. Grab the Fire
Escape Key. Head into Room 307. After a scene, grab the Courtyard Key
in the closet and exit.

Head to the stairs on the east, noted on the map. Head down to the
bottom of the stairs to 1F. The door nearby leads to Canned Juice. Grab
it. Head back up to 2F by taking the stairs you just went down on.

Head up to 3F, down the north stairs, through Room 209, through the
room with the clock and dead man and to the laundry area by the stairs
you first used to get to 2F.

There is a garbage tunnel there. After about 10 minutes of figuring,
the realized the heavy thing you needed to drop into there was the
Canned Juice you found.

Now I ponder... where do we go next? Outside. This took me an hour to
find, but outside, near the gate you first entered from, is a garbage
dump. Examine it to get an Old Man Coin.

Head inside again and to the locked door at the foot of the stairs. Use
the Courtyard Key and head out. In this pool area, run down into it and
shoot the monsters. Head to the cart in the middle and grab the Snake
Coin.

Now head to the other door in this courtyard. It is near the one you
used to get to this building. Head into Room 101. Inside, is Eddie.
After talking to him (It never occurred to me that we had to explore
that area, so we couldn't move ahead), leave.

Head back through the courtyard and climb to 2F. Head to the left side
of the lobby and use the Fire Escape Key to head through. You arrive at
another building... another damn apartment building!

=====================
BLUE CREEK APARTMENTS
=====================

We are in another apartment building, but this one is shorter than
Woodside. We are in a bedroom. Run out into the bathroom. AndyRose2000
told me to check in the toilet for a combination.

Check it and you get a combination. It might be random. Jot it down,
along with arrows' direction. Head into the main area o the same room
and you will find a safe.

Use the combination from the toilet. When going to a new number, turn
the dial in the direction of the arrow after the previous number.
Inside are 4 Handgun Bullets. Thanks to AndyRose2000 for this extremely
helpful tip.

Now we need to head out. Arm the Plank for now. Head out. Outside, find
a door under an exit sign. It is a stairway and to James' right is the
Blue Creek Map.

Use it to follow my next directions. To get back to Woodside
Apartments, use Room 203, as hinted in the map. But we don't need to
bother with that place anymore, but if you want to ever get back to the
areas at the start, that's the path you use.

If you want to save, head to Room 105, on the first floor. For another
dose of ammo, head to Room 109. Head through the white door in that
room and you'll see a scene with Angela.

You know have her knife. But it isn't a weapon! I've tried!

[NOTE: Rumor has it that examining the Knife may affect the game's
ending. I can guess that if you examine the Knife in the item screen, a
new ending occurs. I will have to try this out.]

Collect the coin nearby. It is the Prisoner Coin. Like the Snake and
Old Man Coins you found at Woodside, we are going to need this for a
puzzle coming up.

Head to Room 105. Look at the little drawer with the 5 circles. The
coins you found are needed for it. Since I'm playing on all 3 Riddle
Modes, here are my solutions.

For the HARD Mode, insert the Old Man in the second slot. Put the Snake
in the fourth slot and the Prisoner in the last slot.

For the NORMAL Mode, insert the Old Man in the second slot. Put the
Prisoner in the middle slot and the Snake in the last slot.

For the EASY Mode, insert the Old Man in the first slot. Insert the
Snake in the middle slot and the Prisoner in the last slot.

The drawer should open, revealing a key called the Lyne House Key. A
person named Lyne probably owned this place. The Lyne House Key fits
into Room 209, so head there on 2F.

Inside, you'll hear someone whisper. But I couldn't hear what he said.
If anyone heard, please e-mail me!

Anyway, head to Room 208 via the balcony. Inside 208, there is a Save
Point. SAVE!!! Then grab the Apartment Stairway Key and the Bullets-
you'll need the bullets for your first boss fight!

Travel to the north stairs on 2F. Travel across the balcony again to
209 and turn left to the stairs in the northern area. The Key you got
should work there. Remember to SAVE!!!

Head down to a boss fight! This is fairly hard, so arm the Handgun and
have at least 45 Handgun Bullets.

======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
This is probably the monster President Evil called "Pyramid Head" in
his analysis of SH2. Now it's after us! Arm the Handgun and get as far
as possible from Pyramid Head. Start shooting it. On Normal and Hard
Modes, reload your gun in the menu because James can get hit doing it
manually. Believe me, I know!

Keep shooting and running passed it. It hits pretty hard. That Knife is
the best weapon James can find later and if it is stronger than even
the Handgun, imagine the damage it can inflict on James.

Although it seems P. Head isn't getting hurt, it is. Just listen to the
clank of the bullets. P. Head will eventually go down the stairs. DON'T
FOLLOW! I followed him and I got killed.

The water will drain and you can now exit the damn place. Exit and you
are back outside, on the other side of the blocked area near Woodside
Apartments.

Another away to defeat him, thanks to someone e-mailing me, which I
will post his name soon, is to just dodge him until he leaves the room
down the stairs. Some people say it is impossible to hurt him, and it
is. BUT the shots make it faster for him to surrender.

Which strategy shall YOU use? Experiment and see which one is best for
you. I personally would shoot it out!
======================
BOSS # 1: PYRAMID HEAD
======================

=======================================
ROSEWATER PARK AND PATH TO THE HOSPITAL
=======================================

We need to get to the park James wanted to go to at the start of the
game. Run to Rosewater Park. Use the Map to get there. That bratty
little girl who kicked the Fire Escape Key at Woodside Apartments is in
a scene.

After she leaves, proceed to Rosewater. Run through the park until you
see Maria. She will accompany you for now on. According a few people,
what you do with her affects the game.

Head to Texxon Gas Station and then grab the Steel Pipe protruding from
a car. This is optional, since you get a good amount of ammo for the
rest of the game.

Now look for "Pete's Bowl-A-Rama." Head inside. Turn to the door to the
left and you'll see Eddie and the girl, named Laura.

[Note: if you continue toward the north part of the lake, where SH1
took place, the place will be blocked and a corpse will be there to
tell you to go to Pete's Bowling Alley. I directed you to go there
directly to avoid a long walk.]

Leave the place for now. Talk to Maria and head down the side of
Pete's. Turn right and you'll see a gate. Head through and turn left.
After a scene with Laura, try opening the nearby door.

After another scene, head through the door and up the stairs to the
right. Look for the tiled door and head through to a night club room.
Head out and turn right. Follow Laura to the hospital. Head inside.

===================
BROOKHAVEN HOSPITAL
===================

Hospitals... brings back [UN]lovely memories, especially in SH1 and RE3.
To the left is a Hospital Map- you'll need it like all the maps thus
far. If you want to save, there's a red slab in the Reception Office.

Head to the Document Room, via the Reception Room. There's a Purple
Bull Key by the typewriter. Read the journal nearby, too. Using the
map, find the staircase so we can go to Floor 2. Head inside the
Women's Locker Room. Examine the bear for a Bent Needle.

Head inside the Men's Locker Room. Inside the Exam Room Key. Go back
downstairs and unlock the Examination Room. Head to the Doctor's Lounge
for very important Shotgun Shells.

Travel to 2F again. Head into Exam Room 3. Grab the First Aid Kit.
Check the typewriter for a VERY, VERY important code. JOT IT DOWN ON
PAPER, because it is random!

Head into the room called M2 and grab the Lapis Eye Key. Head into M3 f
or Handgun Bullets and a Health Drink. M6 has a Health Drink. Head to 
Floor 3.

Go to the door leading to the hallway with the "S" Rooms. You need a
code. That code is 7335 on Easy and Normal Riddle Modes and 1328 on
Hard. To find this out, read a memo in the First Floor Exam Room.

Head to Room S3. Maria will leave James' side. There's a key nearby.
Grab the Roof Key. Head over to the roof, via the staircase. Use the
Roof Key to unlock it.

On top is a diary. Read it if you want.

[NOTE: I hear the if you read the diary, you get a certain ending. I
have not confirmed this, but it seems very likely. Stand around it if
you don't want to hear it. Stand for a few moments and then try heading
out.]

As you head back in, something will be blocking the door. Pyramid Head,
from the Blue Creek Apartments, has returned. After a scene, you'll be
back on the third floor, in the Special Treatment Room.

Down there, head through the door left of the sign. Inside, read the
blood-spattered wall. Try to figure out the code. JOT IT DOWN ON THE
SAME PAPER AS THE CODE FROM EARLIER!

Head to Floor 2 and check on Maria. Then head to the last door in that
hall- S14. Inside, is a box that needs 2 codes and 2 keys to open. Use
the Lapis Eye Key and Purple Bull Keys to remove the chains. Now enter
the code you got from the typewriter on the right padlock.

Enter the code you got from the bloody wall on the left and open the
case for... HAIR!!! Ew...

Anyway, this took me a damn half-hour to figure out, so I had to refer
to the BradyGames Guide for this one! Thanks to BradyGames for the tip!
Go to the Shower Room and look at the green slimed faucet. Go to the
item screen and combine the hair from the bear with the bent needle.

To combine, select the hair and then use the "combine." Now select the
bent needle and select "use." You should get an elevator key. Use it on
the elevator on Floor 3F.

Ride it to Floor 1. Head into Room C4 and talk to Laura. After a few
scenes, you are in your second boss battle. Arm the Handgun!

====================
BOSS # 2: MONKEY MEN
====================
DIFFICULTY: Medium
I call them monkey men because they hang on ceilings. Aim your Handgun
up and fire a shot from the Shotgun. There are 2 of them, so keep
moving and strafing.

They can damage, but not VERY much. They'll give you the occasional
hit, but it won't be anything a Health Drink can't heal. But be
careful... as in all survival horror games, damage adds up (I've died
countless times against crows in BioHazard 2!).

Keep firing that Handgun and it'll be your best friend. Compared to 
Pyramid
Head, this guy is a wimp!

After the scenes, we arrive in the Evil Brookhaven Hospital!

MORE NOTES: You'll have to do a lot of dodging, so be very careful. 
Shoot
around 50-100 bullets from the Handgun and you're probably good to go.
====================
BOSS # 2: MONKEY MEN
====================

========================
EVIL BROOKHAVEN HOSPITAL
========================

We are back in the Garden, but now it is EVIL, like the Midwich School
from SH1.

***BLUE GEM: Use it here and like in the first Silent Hill, UFOs will
appear in the sky.

Move through the double doors. Save.

Search Room C2 for a First Aid Kit, which you will definitely need.
Head to the elevator. Ride it to Floor 2, 2F.

Head into M6 and grab the Dry Cell Battery and the Basement Storeroom
Key.

[NOTE: Grab the Dry Cell Battery! Your Flashlight will run out in the
next sections, and the Dry Cell Battery will refill it!]

They are located near some strange color symbol. Grab the memo nearby.
There are also Handgun Bullets and a First Aid Spray in there.

Return to the elevator and go to 3F. When you emerge, there is a weird
door nearby. It needs 2 rings. Didn't the file from the last room talk
about a ring?

Head to S11 and grab the Handgun Bullets and the AMPOULE! This makes
James go to green health AND makes him invincible for about 20 seconds!
Read the memo nearby.

Head to the stairs on 3F by the Storeroom. Descend all the way to the
basement level and use the Basement Storeroom Key to open it. Inside,
push the shelf nearby. After a scene with Maria, climb down the ladder
and grab the Copper Ring.

Travel back to 3F. Head down the elevator to 2F. A radio show message
comes from James' Radio, the one he found in the Construction Site when
that monster first attacked him. Read it closely.

Travel to the Day Room on 2F. Open the refrigerator with Maria's help
to get the Lead Ring. This next section is optional. Otherwise, travel
to the strange door by the elevator on 3F.

******************
TRICK OR TREAT BOX
******************

Here is the sequence box.

    1 2 3
01: O O O
02: O O O
03: O O O

OK. Now we need to press the right buttons. If you remember from the
elevator message, you need the right answers. Well, on the "01" Row,
press button 3. Press button 1 on the "02" Row. On the "03" Row, press
the 3 button.

The box should open, revealing 5 Boxes of Shotgun Shells and 2
Ampoules! Worth the deviating trip!

**********************
END TRICK OR TREAT BOX
**********************

Now we are back on track. Head to the weird door by 3F's working
elevator. Use the Copper and Lead Rings. Head through the door and down
the stairs.

Down there, there is a long tunnel. Pyramid Head seems to have survived
your battle from Blue Creek Apartments, so we need to run! Run down the
tunnel as fast as you can. Keep running.

If Maria is murdered, the game ends. Keep running until you're at an
elevator. After a sad scene, James is at the other section of 1F. Don't
be too sad, though.

Head into the Director's Room and grab the Hospital Key. Check the map,
too. Now we could head out. Exit through the way you came in after
seeing Laura.

===========================
DARK SOUTH VALE SILENT HILL
===========================

Head south on Carroll Street. The travel east on Rendell. Head south on
Munson. There are many items on the ground- search for many of them!
Head back to Saul Street.

Cross the gate. Now run to the trailer you may have gone to before and
save there. Now go to Neely's Bar for an important file. Look on the
window, passed the comment you saw at the beginning of the game.

Head to "Gonzale's Mexican Restaurant" on East South Vale Silent Hill.
Head there by going north on Neely's Street, and East on Sanders. Head
north Lindsay and grab the Wrench and memo.

Now we need to get back to Rosewater Park where we first saw Maria. Go
west on Katz, through the gate, near the Woodside Apartments and Blue
Creek Apartments you explored at the start of the game. Continue for
Rosewater Park.

Head through the left entrance of the park and find the statue of a
praying woman. Behind the face of it, look for a brown spot and dig
there. There is a box in which you will use the Wrench for.

Now grab the Old Bronze Key. Head to the Silent Hill Historical
Society. Head there, which is west of the Rosewater Park. Enter through
the door in the parking lot. Use the Silent Hill Map from the truck in
the start of the game to get there.

==============================
SILENT HILL HISTORICAL SOCIETY
==============================

Head into the only open door in this room. Head through the hole in the
wall. Keep going down for about 3 minutes until you reach a door.
Through it, take the FAK (First Aid Kit). Move to the nearest door for
Handgun Bullets. Now head to the far door to continue.

There is a hole in this room. Jump down. You end up in a well. Arm the
Steel Pipe you found at Texxon Gas Station. Examine every inch of the
wall until you find a message saying some of the wall is weaker.

When you find that part of the wall, hit it with the Plank, or Steel 
Pipe
to find a door. Head through are you are in a new section of the sewers
from the first Silent Hill. Head to your right to find a blocked door. 
But
near it is another door to head through.

At the end of the next room is a hole in the ground. We need to open
the hole first. Head through the nearby door. Grab the Spiral-Writing
Key.

Now the room is filled with Roaches and your Flashlight goes out. The
Dry Cell Battery you found way back in the Evil Hospital. Suddenly, the
door is locked. Head to the nearby panel.

We need to unlock it. Check to see the lighted buttons. This will
change, depending on your difficulty level. But you must only press the
lighted buttons.

Try out all combinations. Eventually, you'll get the code to get out.
Head to the bars to the right. Use the Spiral Writing Key. Jump down
the hole (again).

=============
TOLUCA PRISON
=============

We are in a prison beneath the Historical Society. Run to the nearest
door. Inside is Eddie. After Eddie leaves, check the room for some
items, including a Pig Tablet.

Head out and turn left... all the way to the table. There is a map 
there.
Take it! This place can be confusing!

Head down to the door to the right. Head into the shower and grab the
Seductress Tablet. Use the map to get to the bottom hall of the Toluca
Prison.

In the bottom hall, head to the only open cellblock for a Wax Doll.
Head to the right hall of the Prison now. Head north.

Head to the northern hallway. To your right, head to the seventh cell
block to find the Oppressor Tablet. We have 3 tablets... head to the 
very
large room of this complex.

In this yard is an hanging platform with 3 square engravings. Place all
3 Tablets into it and you'll hear a dying man scream. Nothing happens!
Argh!

Head back through the door you came from... there's a Horseshoe on the
door! Grab it! Head to the west corridor. The best way would be to
cross the northern hallway back to the west hallway, to unlock some
doors.

Head to the very top left door of the west hall. Head through this
visiting room to the other door. On this new corridor, head to the
lowest right room of this hall to get a Lighter.

Outside in the hallway, there is a sewer hole. Before opening it, you
might want to save in the Boy's Bathroom, nearby.

Head back to the sewer hole. Got to the COMBINE option and use it on
the Wax Doll. Then select the lighter and use COMBINE again. Then use
the Horseshoe and the sewer door should open. Thanks to BradyGames'
guide for this tip (since I couldn't figure this one out either :).

We aren't out of the prison yet, though. We are in the basement. Head
through the only open door. Head through the next rooms until you reach
a hole (AGAIN! James' feet will eventually get CRUSHED!).

Head into the nearby elevator. Ride it to another room and save,
because there is a VERY confusing level next.

=========
LABYRINTH
=========

I call this place the labyrinth because it is a Greek word for "maze"
and believe me, it's more than just a maze! It is also something that
constructs itself... if you refer to the map, the maze is building as
James moves!

Across from the doorway is a ladder that is blocked. Turn left and find
a fork in the maze. You should see a nearby ladder you can climb down-
climb down.

Pyramid Head is here, so if you want to fight, use the Handgun to scare
it away. Circle the room until you feel you have made a circle and look
at the map. The red shows you've been through that door, so you should
head through the other one.

Head through. Inside is the Great Knife! It's the Knife that Pyramid
Head used when you fought him in the Blue Creek Apartments and when
Maria was stabbed.

Grab it and 2 ammo boxes. The Great Knife is stronger than the Steel
Pipe and Wooden Plank, but a lot slower. DO NOT USE IT. Head back 
through the
ladder you came from. Using the map you have, head "DOWN" to where a
hole has been made.

Head down. Keep the Handgun equipped.

************
BLOCK PUZZLE
************
Head through the tunnels until you see a block with faces. Here is MY
solution, though it may be random, depending on the difficulty level.
The cube needs to have red eyes facing right side up. Turn the cube
until you see an upside down face with green eyes.

The exit will now be open.

****************
END BLOCK PUZZLE
****************

Head through. Maria is alive! (Weird...).
Anyway, she needs to be freed and there's another way inside, passed
the bars. Head back to the room with that cube.

There is a wire cutter now. OK. Fight your way to the very start of the
level, where you entered from the Toluca Prison. Remember the blocked
ladder?

Cut it with the Wire Cutter and head down the ladder. Head to the first
ladder in a tunnel leading right. Climb that ladder. Follow the next
few tunnels. There are some dead ends, but they only cause a 10-second
devitation. The exits of the tunnels should eventually find you.

Climb a few ladders and turn left, since Pyramid Head is nearby. Climb
the ladders. Equip the Shotgun now. A boss is coming up!

Head down the hallway.

===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================
DIFFICULTY: Medium
Pop this thing with the Handgun. Run around this relatively slow boss
and pump this thing full of bullets. After 50+ bullets, the boss should
die.

This thing can have a devastating attack if it hits you. It smashes you
and can cut your health down pretty low. Be careful, because 3 hits can
spell James' doom. But don't worry. The extremely quick Handgun and
the slow boss are a good fit, especially with the Handgun's sheer
speed.

You can try the Steel Pipe, too, and it might deal SOME damage, but 
that's
only if you are low on Handgun Bullets. Don't let this asshole kill 
James.
===================
BOSS # 3: DOOR BOSS
===================

After killing this bastard, Angela does the honor of torturing it after
death. Head out after Angela leaves. Head to the first door you see.
Read the inscriptions on the bodies. I figured out this puzzle.

EASY MODE: The Kidnapper is innocent.

NORMAL MODE: The Arsonist is innocent.

HARD: The Counterfeiter is innocent.

Remember their positions in this room!

Head to the next door to the left you see. Inside, depending on your
mode, pull the rope that had the inscription of the guy in the previous
room. If you read the papers of the hanged men, you'll see you're in a
similar room.

Pull the rope that had the innocent man and head back to the room with
the bodies. The Persecuted Key is there. Grab it and head through the
only door you haven't been through in the hall outside. Proceed and you
end up in Maria's Cell, but she's now dead. Who did this? Eddie?
Angela? ...you?

Head through the gate. You are in a weird graveyard. Save, grab 3
Shotgun Shell boxes and head down the grave hole. Make sure you have
the Handgun equipped.

Down the hole, you must fight yet another boss.

===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
After Eddie stops talking, hit Eddie with the Handgun 5 times. One
hit from his gun with take you down to the bottom health, so heal with
a First Aid Spray or Ampoule.

After 10+ Handgun hits, Eddie heads into the next room. Follow him
and then start shooting after he shuts the hell up. Run around him and
fire the Handgun.

Eddie's Pistol can kill James in even just 2 hits. Always use a Health
Drink when shot.

Run around Eddie. Fire the Handgun several more times. Eddie will
eventually fall. Unlike the fight with Cybil from Silent Hill 1, Eddie
can't be saved.

NOTES: Try a lot of dodging. The Handgun can be your best friend if you 
are
quick.
===============
BOSS # 4: EDDIE
===============

After Eddie dies, exit this weird place. We are out of the Labyrinth!

==============
BOAT ADVENTURE
==============
James ends up in an area behind the Silent Hill Historical Society he
explored just a few minutes ago. Now that we are out of that damn
strange level, we still have to get to the Hotel over by the northern
area of the lake (By the area where SH1 took place). It's also day
time, again, which is good.

Save and head down the pier.

***BLUE GEM: Use it on the Brown part of the pier, before heading to
the Boat. Like in the Evil Brookhaven Hospital, UFOs will appear. 
Hmmm...

There is a boat you have to row. On Easy and Normal Mode, head toward
the light by simply pressing the D-Pad. Turn right when you get on and
run toward the light.

On Hard mode, you must use the twin sticks. OK. Start by rotating both
sticks right. You should see the light. Now turn the left stick left
and the right stick right, both at the same time.

You should reach the light in no time. You are now in the hotel.

===============
LAVE VIEW HOTEL
===============
Climb the stairs and turn left. Look on a fountain for a Little Mermaid
Box. Grab it and enter the Hotel.

Inside, turn left to get the Hotel Map. Use it to navigate through for
the rest of the game. Enter the Lake Shore Restaurant. Investigate the
piano and you get a Letter from Laura.

Find a table and gather the Fish Key. There are Door Monsters, but they
are smaller than the one you saw at the Labyrinth. The Great Knife can
do damage, but its SLOW. Look for the small set of stairs behind a 
nearby
door. Head down the B1F. look for the Venus Tears Bar. It's locked. But 
in the
nearby elevator, is a Thinner Can. Head up to 1F and to the lobby.

Inside, insert the Little Mermaid Music Box in the center stand, on the
left slot. Save and head through the door left off the check in desk.
Grab the Room 312 Key.

Head up the staircase and turn right through the door. Search the Cloak
Room. There is a briefcase you should open with the Fish Key. Grab the
Room 204 Key. Grab all the other supplies. Head to Room 204. Unlock it
and look for an Employee Elevator Key. Head through the hole in the
room to the next apartment room.

There are photos- use the Thinner to get a code. Use it on the nearby
safe. The Cinderella Box is inside, like the Little Mermaid Box from
the fountain outside. Head to the staircase and then through the other
door.

Head through the white door with the Employee Elevator Key. Inside,
save and there is a save point. Near the elevator is a cabinet. You
MUST store all your items. EVERY LAST ONE.

Head to 1F on the elevator. Ride down and grab another map of the
hotel, displaying some employee areas. Go to the Pantry Room and
collect the Cinderella Box from the shelves.

Enter the Office nearby and grab the Video Tape and Can Opener. Find
the staircase and head down to B1F. Head to the Boiler Room, avoiding
any monsters.

Inside, look to your right and grab a key hanging from a rope. Head to
the Kitchen now. Inside is a can. Use the Can Opener and grab a Light
Bulb.

Head through the other door in the kitchen to the Venus Tears Bar. On
the bar, near the jukebox, use a Light Bulb on the lamp and exit the
room using the Bar Key. You are now back in the hall where you found
the Thinner.

Head back up to the lobby and head to the center piece where you left
the Little Mermaid box. Place the Cinderella Box inside, but we need
the last one- it's in the cabinet near the employee elevator.

Run back there, gather all your items and head back here. Place the
Snow White Box inside. There may be different combinations, so place
them all in whatever order. You should get the Hotel Stairway Key. Head
to the 2F stairs.

On the 3F level, unlock the gate to 3F. Head to Room 312 at last.

***BLUE GEM: If you want the UFO ending (exclusive to the XBOX
version), use the Blue Gem here. The game will then end. For a synopsis
of the UFO ending, head to the Endings section below.

Inside, view the video tape and talk to Laura. Afterwards, exit the
room.

Afterwards... some things will have changed...

====================
EVIL LAKE VIEW HOTEL
====================
Now travel to the Reading Room on 2F. Listen to the headphones.

[After playing more than once, the headphones have been determined to
get you an ending. When I viewed it, I got both the In Water ending and
Leave ending. It depends on your other actions.]

Head to the elevator (the one NOT used by staff). Head to Room 202 to
get warped outside Room 19. From there, run to the elevator. Ride it to
B1F.

Enter the Venus Tears Bar. In the back of the bar, grab 5 Health
Drinks. Run to the kitchen.

Head to the Employee Stairs. After speaking to Angela, exit. When you
exit, you aren't in the previous room anymore- you're at the top of the
employee stairs! Weird...

Head to 1F. The Manager's Office has some Rifle Shells you may need.
Head through the other door that's unlocked. Run down the hall,
avoiding the monsters underneath.

At the end are 9 total save points. SAVE! SAVE!! SAVE!!! Load the
Shotgun, since you know have to fight a boss in the lobby.

===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================
DIFFICULTY: FAIRLY HARD
This is where your skills as a Silent Hill 2 gamer are tested. This
boss is like the one you faced in the Blue Creek Apartments- except
there are TWO of them!

Shoot the Handgun at them. Fire 3 shots before running away from them.
The Handgun's quickness can prove useful. Keep repeating that same
tactic over and over again. Try to save at least 20 Handgun bullets for
the final boss.

Once they stab each other, this boss fight is over.

===========================
BOSS # 5: TWO PYRAMID HEADS
===========================

Run to where the Pyramid Heads are and search them for Scarlet and
Rust-Colored Eggs. Head to the nearby doors. Insert the Scarlet Egg to
the right door and the Rust Colored Egg on the left door.

Head through one of the doors now- it doesn't matter which one.

Cross the hallway- if you listen as in stop running... you get a certain
ending. If you run through without stopping, you probably will get
another ending, based on my experience.

Head through the door at the end. At the other side, turn left and head
up the long stairs. At the top is the boss, and depending on your
actions, it is either:

-Maria, posing as Mary

-OR-

-Mary, pissed because she was killed by James.

Anyway, you must fight a boss. Arm... whatever you want to arm, because
like the last boss, there are 2 strategies to use here.

=======================
BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER
=======================
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
Compared to Eddie, she's a total wimp. Arm whatever you want.

So what should you arm? For the challenge, use the Handgun. For the mid
challenge, use the Shotgun. For the real challenge, use the Hunting
Rifle.

============
HANDGUN TIPS
============
For the Handgun, you must learn to run, shoot, run and shoot. If you
fought Pyramid Head with the Handgun at the Blue Creek Apartment
Building, you might know how to do it.

Shoot, run, shoot, run is the strategy. Since the gun is quick, 3 shots
can be fired before you must run again. Take advantage of the smallness
and quickness of this gun. If the boss can never hit you, just pelting
it with one bullet before running again can guarantee you a victory.
=======================
BOSS # 6: DEMON MONSTER
=======================

********
END GAME
********

You have beaten the damn game already, though it was rather short!
Enjoy your ending!

FAQ POLICY: 
-----------
With 2003 in as of this writing, I have created a new policy for my 
FAQs. Please follow this policy.

E-MAIL POLICY: I no longer answer e-mails about anything found in these 
guides. My FAQs comprehensively answer the questions, and any e-mail 
about content found IN the guides is not tolerated. Please read this and 
make sure what you're e-mailing is within bounds of answering. If I 
haven't answered a question of yours, then you overstepped the 
boundaries. 

HOSTING POLICY: These following websites can host all of my guides in 
one form of another. NO MORE WEBSITES MAY HOST MY GUIDES UNLESS THEY 
HAVE ANY FORM OF COMPENSATION. It's not very fair to have one website 
offer me something, and another one not offer me anything. It's not a 
greed factor, or anything personal, it's just that some websites do much 
better than others to refavor me for my own hard work, and rewarded they 
shall be.

COPYRIGHT POLICY: All my FAQs have copyrights starting 2002. Any 
copyrights before that are ineffective as of January 1, 2003. You 
probably don't care, so don't violate the copyright and you'll be fine.

Sorry to waste your time reading this, but it has to be said in the form 
of the new year.
