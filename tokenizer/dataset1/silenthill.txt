  THE STORY SO FAR: In the simplest form, Silent Hill is the story of a man 
  on a trip with his daughter which went horribly wrong.  While driving at 
  night, Harry Mason was coming around a corner when the figure of a young 
  girl stepped out in front of him.  Harry awoke the next morning in his 
  crashed car, the passenger side door was open and his daughter, Cheryl, 
  was missing.  This is where the game begins.  Harry steps out of his car 
  and sees the shadow of his daughter standing some distance away...
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Like most survival horror games, the main character can be moved forward by 
pressing up, and turning using left and right rather than moving in those 
directions like typical 3D controls.  Holding the square button allows Harry 
to run, you will spend the majority of the game running so get used to it.  
Run forward to see Harry's daughter running off into the distance.  Follow her 
forward and you will automatically be lead down into an alley.  Turn left at 
the end of the alley and go through the gate. You can examine the disgusting 
bloody mess on the ground with the X button.  Keep running down the alley and 
go through the gate at the end.  At this point it will be so dark that Harry 
is forced to take out a lighter so he can see.  From here there is no turning 
back.  Keep moving ahead, the path is entirely linear.  Finally you will come 
to a mangled corpse held up by chains on the fence.  When the enemies appear, 
there is nothing Harry can do but succumb to the attacks of the Demon Babies.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry wakes up in a small diner with a female police 
  officer.  She seems to be experiencing the same weird occurrences that he 
  is.  She introduces herself as Cybil Bennett, from the next town over.  As 
  of now her current plan is to call for backup.  She doesn't think Harry 
  should go back out, but his daughter is missing and he desperately needs 
  to find her.  Before leaving, Cybil gives Harry and Handgun telling him 
  that she hopes he doesn't have to use it.  With that he gets ready to go.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cybil gives you the HANDGUN, which is a weapon for Harry to use.  Press the 
select button and equip it in the menu.  The weapon must be equipped in order 
to be used.  There are a few other things to find in here as well.  Check the 
counter to get a HEALTH DRINK, FLASHLIGHT and RESIDENTIAL AREA MAP.  Beside 
these objects there is a Notepad on the counter.  Examine the Notepad and you 
will be able to save your progress.  Next move over to the other side of the 
counter where you will find a KITCHEN KNIFE and a HEALTH DRINK.  The Kitchen 
Knife is a basic melee weapon with low power and short range, but you don't 
have to worry about ammunition.  Personally in all the times I have played 
through this game, I don't know that I've ever used the knife more than once.
Attempt to leave the diner and the radio will suddenly start buzzing.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: "Huh, radio.  What's going on with that radio?".
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As you go over to examine it, an enormous winged creature will break through 
the window and you'll be given control of Harry again.  Waste no time blasting 
the creature out of the air.  Hold R2 to position yourself in the fighting 
stance and then fire using the X button.  It takes about six bullets to kill 
the monster.  After doing so be sure to pick up the POCKET RADIO.  The radio 
will buzz from now on whenever there are monsters in the area.  If you're 
ready to proceed with the game, then you are free to leave the diner.

The alley where you chased Cheryl the first time is now marked on your map.  
Before going there make an immediate right (from Harry's perspective) when 
coming out of the diner and look on the nearby bench to find HANDGUN BULLETS 
and more HANDGUN BULLETS.  Now turn around and go south (according to your 
map) toward the Queen Burger.  At this point there is a good chance you will 
encounter an enemy.  There are a couple things you should know.  First of all 
ammunition is limited, so in many situations it's best to run rather than 
fight.  If you do choose to fight, only ever use enough bullets to knock the 
monster down, not to kill it.  Once the monster is injured on the ground you 
have a few second to approach it and stomp it with the X button for an instant 
kill.  Anyway check the windowsill of the Queen Burger for a HEALTH DRINK.

Turn left (east) onto Matheson Street and follow it until you reach an alley.  
Go south down the alley to find some HANDGUN BULLETS, and another package of 
HANDGUN BULLETS on the ground.  Now turn around and go up the alley to the 
north.  About half way up there should be a large gate on your left.  Go 
through it and pick up the HEALTH DRINK off the trash can, and the KEY OF 
"WOODMAN" from the pool of blood.  The use for this key will become obvious 
before too long.  Head back through the gate and go north.  Keep going north 
until eventually you bump into some houses.  Turn west here until you hit 
Bachman road and then take a few steps north.  On your right (just check the 
map) there should be a convenience store.  The door is open so go inside.

There are quite a few items to be found in here including a HEALTH DRINK, 
HEALTH DRINK, HEALTH DRINK, FIRST AID KIT and a save point on the counter 
beside the First Aid Kit.  Make sure you collect all the items before leaving 
the store.  Make a right turn outside and start heading up Bachman Road.  At 
the end, on the west side you should be able to find your car.  Examine the 
driver's side door to get a HEALTH DRINK.  Now run south to the intersection of 
Bachman and Finney, then turn west.  Your destination now is the alley marked 
on your map with a red arrow.  Head south down that alley again like you did 
at the beginning of the game.  The alley is now swarming with enemies, but I 
don't recommend you actually fight any of them.  Go through the gate at the 
end and down the alley as you did before.  At the end you won't find any Demon 
Babies however, but you will find HANDGUN BULLETS, HANDGUN BULLETS, and a note 
written by Cheryl.  It says "To school" so Harry marks the location of the 
Midwich Elementary School on his map.  Examine the sketchbook as well and then 
pick up the STEEL PIPE.  The Steel Pipe is a new melee weapon.  It's like the 
knife except with a better range, more power, and overall just better.  Unlike 
the knife I find the Steel Pipe can actually be useful to deal with enemies 
like the dogs without having to waste any of your precious ammunition.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Leave the alley and turn right onto Finney Street.  Run all the way down to 
the east end where you will find a broken police car with the trunk open.  
Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS off the ground and then examine the trunk of the 
Police Car to find a KEY OF "LION."  Turn around and go back a little to 
Ellroy Street and head all the way to the south end.  At the very south end of 
the street, on the west side there is a wooden plank leading across to a 
secret mailbox with the KEY OF "SCARECROW" inside of it.  Also be sure to pick 
up the HEALTH DRINK off the front porch.  Turn around and head back north.

Turn left (west) onto Matheson Street and follow that for quite awhile.  Turn 
south and the alley on Matheson between Levin Street and Bachman Road.  At the 
end of this alley is a FIRST AID KIT.  Keep moving west on Matheson until you 
reach the intersection of Matheson and Levin.  At the south end of Levin 
Street where it reaches a dead end, you can find a HEALTH DRINK on the front 
porch of the house on the east side.  Head back up to Matheson and continue 
west.  At the west end of this road there are some bloody papers on the ground 
that read "Doghouse, Levin St."  Levin Street is just east of here.

Make your way up Levin Street while staying on the west side of the road.  One 
of the houses here has a pretty conspicuous bloody doghouse out front of it.  
Examine the doghouse to get the HOUSE KEY which unlocks the door to the house 
you're standing in front of.  Pick up the FIRST AID KIT from the side table 
near the main door.  The door you pass in the hallway is locked.  If you've 
beaten the game a few times, this door will be unlocked and inside you will 
find a very awkward-to-wield Katana.  Grab the HANDGUN BULLETS from the dining 
room table and the HEALTH DRINK out of the kitchen.  There are more HANDGUN 
BULLETS beside the Notepad, and the Notepad itself allows you to save.

Examine the map beside the back door and you will automatically mark the 
locations of the three keys on your map.  Fortunately if you've been following 
the guide so far, you have already picked them up.  That saves a little time.  
You need all three keys in order to unlock this back door so use them now.  
When you get outside it suddenly goes completely dark.  Harry automatically 
turns on his flashlight.  The light can be turned on and off with the circle 
button, but there's really no reason to turn it off at this point.

Examine the patio table to get HEALTH DRINK, and HEALTH DRINK.  Take the gate 
leading out of the backyard to the other areas of Silent Hill.  Turn right and 
go north up the alley, then west and north again to a dead end at the top of 
Midwich Street.  Over on the west side of the street behind one of the columns 
you can find some HANDGUN BULLETS and a HEALTH DRINK lying on the ground.  
From here run south and turn east on Matheson Street.  Run south down the 
alley from Matheson Street that leads to Bloch Street.  Along the way keep 
your eyes on your right to find some more HANDGUN BULLETS.  

It's almost time to head for the school now.  Just south of the school, parked 
on the west side of the road is a large school bus.  Go inside of it and pick 
up the HEALTH DRINK and HEALTH DRINK off the front seat.  There's also a 
Notepad at the back of the bus which you can use to save your game.  With this 
taken care of you are now ready to enter the school.  It's marked on your map 
just northwest of here.  Approach the main doors and press X to go inside.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sitting on the left side of the front lobby is the SCHOOL MAP which will be an 
invaluable asset to you when trying to find your way around this building.  
Proceed through the doors into the main hall and turn left.  Examine the 
bloody notes behind the counter here.  Each one is a clue to something you 
will have to do later.  There's also a door here behind the reception that 
leads into some kind of lounge.  Grab the HANDGUN BULLETS off the table and go 
back to the main hallway.  Head east this time and go south through the door 
to the right of the lobby.  This is the infirmary.  In here you can find a 
FIRST AID KIT on the bed, and a HEALTH DRINK inside of the cabinet.  Also be 
aware of the Notepad sitting on one of the shelves.  Save and leave here.

Go through the doors leading north out into the courtyard.  Be careful of the 
Demon Babies that occupy this area.  Keep moving north and go through the 
double doors at the top.  More Demon Babies to be found in this hallway.  
Again, head through the doors to the north and pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS off 
of the bench at the side.  Turn around and return to the previous room.  next 
we're going to go through the double doors on the far west side.  Run all the 
way south (well almost all the way) and examine the double doors leading east.  
This should unlock them (they just lead back to where you came in, so don't go 
through the doors.)  The only place you can go from here is up the stairs.

Kill off any Demon Babies you find in this hallway to start.  Head down to the 
far south end of the hall and go into the women's washroom.  Be prepared to 
fight off two Demon Babies in a small enclosed space here.  Pick up the 
HANDGUN BULLETS off the floor and leave.  Go into the men's washroom as well 
just to check it out.  Enter the classroom beside the men's washroom and go 
north into the other classroom from that one.  Kill any Demon Babies you find 
and get the HEALTH DRINK from a table up near the blackboard.  There are two 
sets of doors leading to the eastern hallways, take the more northern of the 
two.  Check out the room marked Lab Equipment Room.  Locate the purple bottle 
on the shelf and pick it up to get a CHEMICAL.  With nothing else to find in 
this room, go back out to the hallway and enter the Chemistry Lab.

Examine the old man's hand on the table which is covering something.  While 
standing directly beside it, open up your inventory and use the Chemical. When 
the hand is dissolved, Harry is able to pick up the GOLD MEDALLION.  Make sure 
you also pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS at the back of the room before you leave.  
Head to the east end of the hall and go through the double doors, then north 
into the Library.  There are some enemies in here, but they're just harmless 
spirits which cannot hurt you.  Grab the FIRST AID KIT off the table.  Leave 
the Library through the south door and go east into the northern classroom.  
From here head south into the other classroom, watch out for Demon Babies!  
Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS off the table and exit through any door.

Run to the south end of the hall and then proceed through the double doors 
leading west.  Go into the Locker Room first.  Find the noisy locker and 
examine it.  Leave the locker room and go back east to the previous hallway.  
Descend down the stairs here to the first floor.  Go into the more northern of 
the two classrooms and find the HANDGUN BULLETS sitting on the table.  Head to 
the south end of the hall and unlock the double doors leading west back to 
where you first entered the school.  From here head north to the courtyard.  
At the southeast corner of the courtyard there is a golden emblem on a pillar.  
Stand in front of this and use the Gold Medallion to set it into place.

Head through the northern doors and then go west.  You need to get back up to 
the second floor.  On the southern side of the second floor there is a room 
called the Music Room, that is your destination right now.  Before examining 
the piano, examine the sheet music on the wall.  This is the solution to the 
riddle of which keys to play.  When you attempt to play the piano you'll 
notice that some keys work and some don't.  The ones that don't are actually 
tied to switches and you have to play them in the proper order.  The order is 
explained on the sheet music with the riddle, and the answer is as follows:

Pelicans are white (corresponds to the colour of the key.)  You have a white 
key, then a dove (also white) flies past (further to the right.)  You have one 
white key, and one white key to the right of it.  A raven (black) is further 
than the dove and the pelican, so you have white, white, black.  Another white 
goes somewhere, but it doesn't tell you where.  The crow stops immediately, 
meaning far to the left.  The order of the birds also matters and must be 
taken into account with the solution.  The final answer is:
   _______________________________________________________________________
  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
  |     |  5  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |  3  |     |
  |     |_____|     |_____|     |     |_____|     |_____|     |_____|     |
  |        |           |        |        |           |           |        |
  |        |     1     |        |        |     4     |     2     |        |
  |________|___________|________|________|___________|___________|________|

Going in order from one, two, three, four, five of course.  The diagram is a 
little crude but should correspond exactly to the keys' position.  Once the 
proper combination has been input, a SILVER MEDALLION will drop from its 
position above.  Head back again to the first floor courtyard and place the 
Silver Medallion into where it's supposed to sit.  When this is done, go south 
through the doors and then east into the eastern hallway.  Head down the 
stairs into the basement and enter the Boiler Room.  Examine the big red 
button and choose to turn it on.  Once again you need to make another trip 
back to the courtyard.  Examine the doors of the clocktower where you have 
been placing the medallions, it is no longer locked.  Climb down the ladder 
and go through the underground, then back up the ladder on the other side.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry comes out of the clocktower a little dazed and 
  wondering where he is.  Walking forward he notices an odd symbol etched 
  into the ground before him.  Players who are familiar with the Silent Hill 
  series know exactly what is going on, but technically this is the very 
  first time in the series we visit the "alternate" version of something.  
  Basically in the world of Silent Hill they like to take areas that are 
  really creepy, and multiply them by a thousand.  This here is the 
  "alternate school" which basically puts the first school to shame.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We will start by going through the double doors to the north.  Be careful of 
Demon Babies when you do.  Continue north into the next room with the giant 
fan and pick up both the FIRST AID KIT and the HANDGUN BULLETS off the 
benches.  Head east and go up into the hall.  Watch out for the new enemies in 
here, the cockroaches.  You can tell these are some badass bugs when you still 
have to kick them even after using a bullet.  There are two doors leading 
south, take the more eastern of the two down and then go east into the 
classroom.  Head south and watch out because there are three Demon Babies in 
this classroom.  Leave the room through either door and check the bench in the 
hallway to find a HEALTH DRINK.  Proceed through the western double doors.

Start by checking out the evil Infirmary.  Just like before you will find a 
FIRST AID KIT, a HEALTH DRINK as well as a Notepad for saving your game.  
Leave this room and go through the doors leading to the lobby.  As you 
probably guessed there is no way to leave the school, but if you examine the 
wheelchair you will get an AMPOULE.  Ampoules are the most potent healing 
items in the game.  Return to the hallway and go through the door behind the 
reception desk.  In this room you will find some HANDGUN BULLETS sitting on 
the couch.  Stand in front of the odd door and use the Picture Card you found 
recently.  Now that you have unlocked this door, go through it.

Now this is where things get weird.  Go first into the men's washroom, not the 
women's washroom (this is important.)  Open up the bathroom stall to find 
yourself face to face with a hanging corpse.  Forget about the corpse for now, 
your focus should be the SHOTGUN sitting on the ground in front of it.  Pick 
up the Shotgun and leave the washroom.  All right now look at your map in the 
hallway and see that it says "1F" at the upper left corner.  Well go into the 
women's washroom and look at your map.  Suddenly it says "2F."  The women's 
washroom in the alternate school is a warp portal between floors somehow.  
Leave the washroom and go into the men's washroom on the second floor.  Pick 
up the HANDGUN BULLETS, HANDGUN BULLETS and SHOTGUN SHELLS.  To get back to 
the first floor all you have to do is enter and leave the women's washroom.

Head north on the first floor and unlock the double doors leading east.  When 
you reach a dead end and can't go any further north, head into the classroom.  
Demon Babies and Cockroaches populate this room.  When you've got them taken 
care of go north into the next classroom.  Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS from 
the chair and then try to leave through the northeast door.  As you do...
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: As Harry tries to leave the room suddenly the phone 
  starts ringing.  He picks up the line and on the other end he can hear the 
  voice of his daughter who sounds scared, but the line cuts off.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Leave through the northeast door and unlock the large double doors leading 
east.  Go through them and then up into the Storage room.  Pick up the pink 
RUBBER BALL from the table.  Leave this room and return to the west hallway.  
With nowhere else to go, climb the stairs up to the second floor.  Enter the 
first classroom and be very careful of Demon Babies.  You should be able to 
find some HANDGUN BULLETS on a chair in here.  Leave this room not through the 
south door, but the east door on the south side.  Just pick up the HEALTH 
DRINK off the bench in the hall then turn around and go back into the 
classroom.  Take the south door and pick up the SHOTGUN SHELLS off the chair, 
then go through either door to get back to the hallway again.  

Proceed through the double doors leading east here.  Kill any enemies you come 
across and run over to the Locker Room again.  When you go inside that same 
damn locker is pounding, so examine it.  Since there's nothing inside, leave 
the room.  Oh wait... examine that corpse to get the LIBRARY RESERVE KEY.  
Turn around and go back through the previous hallway, through the classroom 
and up to the north end.  Proceed through the double doors leading east.  Run 
to the east side and use the Library Reserve Key on the Library Reserve.  Pick 
up the FIRST AID KIT and then go through the door into the Library.

Read the book which is sitting on the table.  Keep this little fairy tale in 
mind because it just might be a tip relating to a certain upcoming boss.  Make 
sure you pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS and then take the south door into the 
hallway.  At the moment there is nowhere you can go here, so head back west 
through the hallway and go up the stairs to the third floor (the roof).  Go 
out the door and locate a hole next to some blood.  Examine the hole and you 
will see a key just out of reach.  Go over and find the drainage valve.  
Choose to turn it on when Harry asks.  You will see that the water doesn't 
wash away the key.  Walk over to the hole where the water drains at the 
corner, and use the Rubber Ball you found.  Turn the water on again and it 
will wash around to where you say the key.  In order to actually find it you 
now need to run back to the first floor and go out into the courtyard.

The key can be found in a very conspicuous location up near the northeast 
corner of the courtyard.  Examine the key to acquire the CLASSROOM KEY which 
is exactly what you need.  Now would be a good time to go back to the 
Infirmary and save your game by the way.  Return to the second floor and run 
east through the northern hallway, past the Library Reserve to reach the 
locked classroom.  Open it up by using your Classroom Key.  Be careful here 
because you'll be attacked by three Demon Babies.  Head south into the next 
classroom and pick up the HEALTH DRINK off the chair.  Leave the classroom 
through the west door and find the HEALTH DRINK sitting on a bench in the 
hallway.  Descend down the stairs at the far end and when you reach the first 
floor, unlock the door to the north and go through it.  Now is your final 
chance to save the game before the boss, and it's a perfect chance since 
you're about three seconds away from the Infirmary.  When you're ready go down 
to the basement and enter the Storage room to find SHOTGUN SHELLS, SHOTGUN 
SHELLS and AMOUPLE.  Leave the room, reload your Shotgun and equip it.  

Through the door leading into the Boiler Room you'll find something a bit 
puzzling.  You can't proceed any further because there are bars in your way.  
On the left is a handle which moves the gate in one manner, while the one on 
the right moves it differently.  To get through you must strategically use a 
combination of both.  The solution is to examine the left crank and choose to 
move it right.  Now examine the other crank (on the right) and choose to move 
that one right... twice.  There is your solution.  The boss awaits.

|| The Lizard makes for a decent first boss, and he can actually be pretty  ||
|| tough if you don't know what you're doing.  If you do know what you're   ||
|| doing however he can be quite easy.  The trick is timing and agile       ||
|| movement.  The boss is fought in two "stages."  During the first stage   ||
|| his only attack is like a headbutt.  He'll wander around the area and    ||
|| nudge you with his face.  It takes at least three of these to bring you  ||
|| from green to yellow damage and at least four or five more before it     ||
|| actually kills you.  The danger is minimal but you still need to heal if ||
|| you start to get hurt.  What you want to do is whip out the Shotgun and  ||
|| start blasting the monster in the face.  Shoot a couple times and then   ||
|| reposition yourself if necessary.  After about four of five shells to    ||
|| the face, the monster will get angry and enter the second stage of the   ||
|| battle.  The only attack it has now is when it opens up its face and     ||
|| tries to eat you.  This is a far cry from its first attack, now you're   ||
|| looking at something which is an almost guaranteed one-hit kill.         ||
|| Fortunately there's an easy solution.  Get yourself in a position where  ||
|| you're facing the boss and he's facing you, but there is a lot of        ||
|| distance behind you.  Wait until the first sign he is going to open his  ||
|| mouth then hold down to start walking backward (don't hold square to     ||
|| hop, just walk backward.)  While walking you can shoot with slowing down ||
|| so blast a couple of Shotgun Shells into the beast's open mouth.  On     ||
|| normal difficulty you can actually fire two shots in a matter of         ||
|| seconds, and kill the boss with those two back-to-back blasts.           ||

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry blacks out after the boss is defeated, and wakes 
  up in the school's Boiler Room during the day.  All traces of the monster 
  are gone, and all traces of the Alternate School are gone as well.  
  Everything is back to normal, or as normal as it can be in Silent Hill.  
  As he goes to leave the school he hears the sound of a church bell ringing 
  and decides to see if perhaps there may be someone else there.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pick up the K. GORDON KEY and stick it into your inventory.  The school is no 
longer evil in any way so you can pretty much roam around all you like without 
having to worry about monsters or scariness.  If you're looking for a place to 
save your game, the save point in the school bus is still readily available.  
Follow Bradbury Street east a little bit and then go up the alley.  You should 
be able to find your way into another backyard from here and use the K. Gordon 
Key on the backdoor of the house.  Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS and more 
HANDGUN BULLETS in the kitchen, then leave the house through the front door.

The church is circled on your map, so finding your way there now shouldn't be 
difficult at all.  There are no obstacles in your path like there were for the 
school.  Before we go there, head north on the road until you reach a dead 
end.  Check the porch of the house on the east side of the road to get a 
HEALTH DRINK.  Now run south and turn east onto Bradbury Street.  Run along the 
north sidewalk and just before you reach the alley you should be able to find 
another HEALTH DRINK on one of the benches.  Make your way up the alley 
keeping your eye on the right side for some HANDGUN BULLETS.  When you pop out 
at the top, turn right and make your way to the church.  When you reach it 
don't go inside.  Take a look at your map and see that east of the church is a 
gas station.  Head there and find the open door on the side of the gas 
station.  Inside this little room there is a Notepad and a box of HANDGUN 
BULLETS.  If you've beaten the game before then there is also a Gas Canister 
if I'm not mistaken, which is used with either the Rock Drill or Chainsaw.

Leave the gas station and head down Ellroy Street going south.  At the end 
check the west side for a lone truck with both SHOTGUN SHELLS and some HANDGUN 
BULLETS beside it.  GO back up to the intersection of Bloch Street and Ellroy, 
then run a little bit east.  On the far south side there is a broken set of 
stairs leading to both a FIRST AID KIT and some SHOTGUN SHELLS.  That covers 
just about all of the items that you can find in this area.  If you're ready 
then go back to the church and head inside to trigger a cutscene.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: This crazy old hag seems to know all about Cheryl 
  somehow.  Harry demands she tell him everything she knows about Cheryl, 
  but she seems mostly concerned with an object she calls Flauros.  They are 
  objects supposedly designed to counteract the power of the underworld.  
  The woman tells Harry to make haste to the hospital, so at least he has 
  some idea of where to go.  With that, she simply walks out of the church.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After she is done talking, approach the pedestal and take both the FLAUROS and 
the DRAWBRIDGE KEY.  Also be sure to pick up the HEALTH DRINK sitting on the 
ledge to the left of the pedestal.  The only other noteworthy object in this 
place is the Notepad back near the door.  Save your game and exit the church.  
Head all the way east from here to reach the drawbridge.  The control tower is 
on the south side.  Before going up the stairs check out the lower room of the 
tower.  Inside is a Rock Drill, but you can only pick it up if you've beaten 
the game before and found the Gasoline back at the station.  Head up the 
stairs to the control booth and pick up the SHOPPING DISTRICT MAP.  Also make 
sure you pick up the HEALTH DRINK.  Examine the control panel and then open up 
your inventory and use the Drawbridge Key.  Agree to press the switch and the 
bridge will lower.  Head down and cross over into the Shopping District.

Proceed east until you have the chance to go north in the new part of town.  
On the north side of the bridge there is a HEALTH DRINK sitting on a red drum 
beside some kind of shack.  When you get across check the broken stairs on the 
south side of the drawbridge to get some HANDGUN BULLETS.  At the very first 
intersection there is a police station on the corner, and the door is 
unlocked.  Enter the police station and take the SHOTGUN SHELLS off the shelf 
in the front hall.  Don't miss the HANDGUN BULLETS and HANDGUN BULLETS on the 
counter either.  One of the doors is jammed but you can go through the other.  
More SHOTGUN SHELLS can be found in here as well as a memo on the desk.  Save 
your game again if you need to and then collect the HANDGUN BULLETS.  That's 
all there is to find in here so leave the police station entirely.

I forgot to mention that you need to be careful of the new enemies, the Monkey 
Men.  They can deal quite a bit of damage if they manage to leap on you.  Our 
next destination is quite a distance away.  Head all the way east to the 
intersection of Sagan and Simmons, then go south to the intersection of 
Simmons and Koontz.  Head a little bit west on Koontz then south down the 
alley to find both HANDGUN BULLETS and a HEALTH DRINK.  Just north of the 
alley on the other side of the street there is another HEALTH DRINK on one of 
the tables out front of the restaurant.  If you're ready to continue with the 
game then head for the gates of the hospital now and go through them.  You'll 
have to fight off a couple of dogs before you can go inside.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start by examining the Notepad on the reception desk and saving your game.  As 

you walk ahead you should hear a gunshot somewhere off in the distance.  
There's only one door that you can go through on this floor right now.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: Inside this room sits a man holding a handgun with blood 
  at his feet.  He fires a shot but not aiming for Harry.  Harry introduces 
  himself to the man who seems relieved to find another human being.  The 
  man says he is Dr. Michael Kaufmann and he works at the hospital, when he 
  woke up everything was like it is now.  Harry explains his situation and 
  Michael is sorry to hear about everything that is happened, but is 
  determined not to just sit around. Michael wishes him good luck and exits.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proceed through the door next to the one you came in from, but not on the 
opposite side.  This one should take your behind the reception desk where you 
can pick up both a FIRST AID KIT and the HOSPITAL MAP off of the wall.  Return 
to the previous room and go through the third door, the one you haven't gone 
through yet.  Leave this small room to reach a hallway.  Try the doors along 
the side one by one until you find one that is open.  In this room there is a 
HOSPITAL BASEMENT MAP sitting on the table.  Pick it up then go through the 
door next to it.  This is some kind of conference room, on the table is a 
BASEMENT KEY.  Make sure you don't miss it.  Go next door into the kitchen and 
collect both the HEALTH DRINK and a PLASTIC BOTTLE which is sitting on the 
counter.  The next room to check is the director's office.  At the back of the 
room you will find some liquid spilled all over the floor.  Stand above the 
liquid and use the Plastic Bottle in your inventory to collect some.  This 
liquid won't come into play until near the end of the game, and will play a 
vital role in determining which of the game's endings you get.

With this stuff out of the way, use the Basement Key to unlock the door 
leading down to the basement and descend down the stairs.  Turn on your 
flashlight and get ready to shoot some Cockroaches.  Before doing anything 
else go into the generator room and press the switch to activate the power.  
The elevator should be working now so go into it and press the button for 
second floor.  Try the door to find that it's locked and go back into the 
elevator.  Ride up to the third floor now and try the door to see that it's 
locked.  Go back into and examine the elevator panel only to find that there 
is now a button for the fourth floor.  Press that button to ride up.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the undocumented fourth floor of the evil Alternate Hospital.  
There are quite a few doors on this floor but believe it or not, all of  them 
are jammed.  The only thing you can do is run to the end of each hall and go 
through the doors leading to the next hallway.  When you come to the stairs, 
take them down to the third floor (you can use your map again here.)  Be 
careful of the new enemy you'll encounter, the Nurses.  Start by checking out 
Room 302 and using the Notepad to save your game.  Collect the SHOTGUN SHELLS 
sitting on the bed and leave the room again.  Your next destination is Room 
304 where you'll find (in addition to a Nurse) a HEALTH DRINK sitting on the 
table, and a steel plate screwed into the wall.  There's nothing you can do 
with it now so just ignore it.  Go into the linen room and then out the other 
door to reach the next hallway.  Watch out for more Nurses!

The next room to check out is the storage room.  In here you will find HANDGUN 
BULLETS, FIRST AID KIT as well as a BLOOD PACK which will be used at a later 
time.  Exit this room and head into Room 306 to find a PLATE OF "CAT" hanging 
on the wall.  The last place to go on this floor is back and into the men's 
washroom.  In there is where you will find the PLATE OF "TURTLE" sitting on 
the windowsill.  Go though the door leading back to the stairs and take them 
down to the second floor.  Head through the double doors to enter the hall.

More Nurses here, you know what to do (Shotgun.)  Your first destination here 
is Room 201.  Go in there and pick up the LIGHTER off the bed.  Now leave this 
room and head into Room 204.  Room 204 is occupied by some kind of weird 
tentacle monster.  As you can see, while the monster does have an interest in 
biting you it also has an interest in the puddle of blood on the floor.  
Knowing this you need to give it a more appealing distraction.  Approach the 
monster and open your inventory.  Use the Blood Pack here and it will distract 
the monster, allowing you to walk up and grab the PLATE OF "HATTER."  Inside 
the Nurse Center you will find the place where you have to put all those 
plates you've been finding, but you need four before you can solve the puzzle 
so there's really no reason to go in there, at least for the moment.

Since you can't get to the eastern hallway, go back into the stairwell and 
descend down to the first floor.  Through the double doors the enemies are 
slightly different, you'll be fighting male Nurses or Doctors or something.  
They fight in pretty much the same way.  Go into the medicine room, and try the 
door but you'll find that it is locked.  The room across from the medicine 
room is open, but empty.  The office beside it has some HANDGUN BULLETS 
sitting on the table.  You'll find a HEALTH DRINK in the kitchen but not much 
else.  In the director's office you'll find the PLATE OF "QUEEN" as well as a 
Notepad to save your game.  Proceed through the door to the basement.

Watch out for the two Nurses that attack you simultaneously down here.  Go 
into the generator room and pick up the HAMMER.  The Hammer is a fantastic 
short range and very powerful melee weapon, much better than the Steel Pipe.  
Enter the morgue and pick up the HEALTH DRINK on one bed and AMPOULE on the 
other.  Enter the elevator and ride it up to the third floor.  Make your way 
to the stairs on the other end and run down to the second floor.  From here go 
into the Nurse Center.  It's time to solve this damn puzzle.  The clues to 
the puzzle can be found on the wall nearby.  I encourage you to try and 
figure it out for yourself but I'm just going to give you the answer.

                          |____| |________| |____|

Obviously the two letters on the plates indicate which one to put there.  For 
QU place the Plate of "Queen", for CA place the Plate of "Cat" etc.  When all 
of the plates have been set into place the door will be unlocked.  Unlock the 
double doors leading back west for simplicity sake and then head south into 
the operating prep room.  Kill the nurses and open up the door to the 
operating room.  Pick up the BASEMENT STOREROOM KEY from the table and go back 
out into the hallway.  Next you'll want to go into the intensive care unit to 
find the DISINFECTING ALCOHOL.  Inside Room 206 there is a FIRST AID KIT 
sitting on the chair.  Unlock the door at the north end of the hallway and go 
through it to reach the elevator.  Ride the elevator down to the basement and 
use the Basement Storeroom Key on (you guessed it) the basement storeroom.

In here you will find on the various shelves, HADNGUN BULLETS and SHOTGUN 
SHELLS.  Examine the oddly conspicuous cabinet from the side, not the front to 
get the option to move it.  Inside this room there is a trap door covered in 
vines.  Pour Disinfecting Alcohol all over the vines and then use the Lighter 
in your inventory to burn them away.  Proceed down into the sub-basement.  
Kill all of the Nurses here (it might help to turn off your flashlight if 
you're not using a gun) then go through the door on the left and kill all of 
the Nurses in there as well.  The first door on your left just leads to an 
empty room so instead try the third door on your left for a quick scene.

Pick up the EXAMINATION ROOM KEY off the table in here and then leave the 
room.  Return to the previous hallway and find the door on the opposite side 
that you can go through.  There is a VIDEO TAPE sitting on the bed in here, 
pick it up and go back upstairs through the trap door.  If you wish you can 
run up to the third floor and go into the room with the VCR.  Use the video 
tape on the VCR to trigger a scene.  Head back up to the first floor and 
go through the medicine room to reach the examination room.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Downstairs in the sub-basement Harry found a very dark 
  and isolated room which appeared to have been occupied recently.  Sitting 
  on the desk was a picture of a girl named "Alessa."  Beside that picture 
  Harry found a key to a door upstairs.  Now he unlocks this door and walks 
  inside.  There is a woman in this room, a nurse.  She says her name is 
  Lisa Garland and she has no idea what's going on.  Just like everyone else 
  he meets (beside the woman in the church) she doesn't know anything about 
  his daughter.  Harry asks the woman if she knows anything about the weird 
  stuff in the sub-basement, but Lisa says that she and the others are under 
  strict orders to never enter even the basement storeroom.  

  What happened after defeating the lizard starts happening again.  Harry 
  loses consciousness and wakes up in the hospital during the day.  The 
  woman from the church comes into the room, giving her name, Dahlia 
  Gillespie.  She says that evil is trying to devour the town, hasn't he 
  seen the crest marked all over the town?  It's the mark on the ground in 
  the courtyard of the alternate school, the mark of Samael...

Pick up the ANTIQUE SHOP KEY that Dahlia Gillespie left on the table for you.  
The Antique Shop is located at the far north end of Simmons Street on the east 
side of the road.  Go down and use your key on the door.  Save your game when 
you get inside the room and then examine the cabinet on the wall.  Choose to 
push it when you get the option and you'll reveal a hole in the wall.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Cybil Bennett who we haven't seen since the beginning of 
  the game is back, she says she couldn't get out of town no matter how hard 
  she tried and she saw Harry coming down here.  Cybil did see a girl 
  walking through the fog, but she disappeared at the end of a dead-end 
  road.  Cybil suggests that drug trafficking might have something to do with 
  the odd behavior of some of the people, but it certainly doesn't explain 
  the odd events going on in the town.  Lastly Harry asks Cybil about the 
  "other world", the alternate world where he met Lisa...

Head down the hall to the end to find an altar.  Examine the wall on your 
right to get an AXE, personally I still prefer the Hammer.  When you try to 
leave this room the fire will flare up and another scene will trigger.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry is back in the hospital with the nurse, Lisa.  She 
  says that he was having a bad dream.  Harry asks Lisa about Dahlia 
  Gillespie, who has heard something about her.  Supposedly Dahlia's child 
  died in a fire and since that time she's been kind of crazy.  Lisa also 
  knows something about Dahlia's mention of the town being devoured by 
  darkness.  Long ago before Silent Hill became a resort town, many people 
  in the area were part of a black magic cult.  Some of the original 
  founders of the town have since died in mysterious accidents.  Just as 
  Lisa finishes talking about the cult, Harry wakes up yet again.

You will wake up in the antique shop, but in the alternate world again.  Leave 
the shop to find yourself in Alternate Silent Hill.  If you zoom in on your 
map you'll see that to the south is the Silent Hill Town Center, this is your 
current destination.  When you get close to it the camera will take a 
stationary position on an area of wall with a large hole in it.  Go through 
the hole to get inside the town center.  There isn't a map for this place but 
the path is relatively linear.  Go forward and start up the escalator to 
trigger a short scene.  Make a left (from Harry's perspective) on the second 
floor and locate the door into the jewelry shop.  In here you can find RIFLE 
SHELLS, RIFLE SHELLS, FIRST AID KIT and a save point over on the counter.  
Leave the shop and make a left turn, you'll fall and trigger a boss fight.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| Lying on the ground over in the corner of the area where you fight the   ||
|| boss is a fairly conspicuous HUNTING RIFLE.  Despite the novel-ness of   ||
|| this new gun, it's not the best tool for the job.  Equip the Shotgun in  ||
|| this scenario and get ready to blast this vile creature.  The way it     ||
|| works is that the Larva comes up out of the ground, shoots a toxic cloud ||
|| at you and then moves toward you.  If you're hit by the toxic cloud you  ||
|| take damage, if the boss runs into you, you take damage.  The best way   ||
|| to avoid the bosses attacks is to utilize the strafing power of the L1   ||
|| and R1 buttons.  Always keep moving or you'll be hit for sure.  When the ||
|| boss pops out of the ground, take a couple of second to get out of the   ||
|| way, but try your very best to stay as close as you can while still      ||
|| avoiding the attack.  The closer you are the more damage your Shotgun    ||
|| will do.  You can get off about two shots on average before the boss     ||
|| buries itself under the ground again.  Rinse and repeat until it's dead. ||
||__________________________________________________________________________||
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
When the boss is defeated, it will use whatever strength it has left to break 
through the glass door, allowing you passage to escape.  Proceed through this 
hole to get back outside again.  There are quite a few places you can actually 
reach now, but there are very few (if any) items or bonuses you'll find 
anywhere.  The one place that you will want to visit before going to your next 
destination however is the police station.  Pick up both the HANDGUN BULLETS 
and the RIFLE SHELLS from the counter.  There's also a Notepad in here in case 
you want to save your game after defeating that boss.  Your next destination?  
That would be Alchemilla Hospital, of the Alternate Hospital I should say.  
Enter the room where you met Michael Kaufmann in the "normal" hospital.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry finds Lisa again in the Alternate Hospital, and 
  asks her how he can get to the lake.  Bachman Road is the normal route but 
  the road is blocked.  She tells Harry that there's a water works by 
  Midwich that should have an underground tunnel that can get you to the 
  lake.  She doesn't want to be alone, but for whatever reason she doesn't 
  think it would be a good idea for her to leave the hospital and go with 
  Harry.  He tells her to just wait patiently for him to come back.

When you get out of the hospital there is literally no other path for you to 
take except for the one which leads you directly up to the roof, and...

|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| While the Moth is probably the most difficult boss you've faced so far,  ||
|| there's no reason a patient person can't get through this battle with    ||
|| little to do damage.  For those looking to go on an offensive, the       ||
|| Shotgun is the weapon of choice, while those who wish to avoid damage    ||
|| should opt for the Hunting Rifle.  The Moth has two basic attacks, a     ||
|| poison cloud spray from the air similar to the previous boss' attack,    ||
|| and a stab with its stinger that does a bit more damage than the former. || 
|| To avoid being hit by these attacks and still kill the boss you need to  ||
|| equip the Hunting Rifle and run back and forth from one side of the roof ||
|| to another between the furthest two points.  When you stop and turn      ||
|| around you will only have time to fire off one shot before you have to   ||
|| run back.  If you're willing to take at hit then you can probably get    ||
|| off about five or six shots before the Moth gets close enough to attack  ||
|| physically.  It takes a good 15 shots or so on the normal difficulty     ||
|| from various ranges to kill the boss, less with the close-range Shotgun. ||

Fortunately you don't actually have to run all the way back to the Midwich 
Elementary School manually, once you cross the drawbridge the game 
automatically places you next to the water works.  There's a lock on the door 
but a single shot from the Handgun, or perhaps the Hammer should do the trick 
in getting it off.  Examine the stairs to climb down into the sewer.

At the bottom of the stairs head through the arch and then follow that path 
for a ways until you come to a dead end.  The path forks both left and right, 
take the left branch and do not stray from this path.  It will take you to a 
corner, turn left and eventually lead you to a dead end with some RIFLE 
SHELLS.  Turn around and go back the way you came a little bit until you first 
chance to cross over to the other side.  When you do, turn left and go back in 
the same direction you were going to get the Rifle Shells, except now you're 
on the other side.  Pick up the HEALTH DRINK, HANDGUN BULLETS and the SHOTGUN 
SHELLS on the ground here.  Turn around and go back in the opposite direction 
while staying on this path until you come to a dead end.  Cross to the other 
side at the dead end and continue in that direction until you reach a door.

This door is locked and there's nothing you can do about it right now.  Turn 
around at the locked door and cross over at the first chance you get.  Proceed 
back in the direction of the locked door except on this side now, and you'll 
reach another door... but this one isn't locked.  There's really only one 
direction you can go here and it eventually takes you to some kind of sewer 
office.  Pick up the SEWER MAP off the table and use the Notepad to save your 
game.  Examine the key rack beside the desk to get a SEWER KEY.  Leave the 
sewer office through the door right beside you and run west (according to your 
map) until you reach a corner and then cross to the north side.  Head a bit 
west again then go south, and keep going all the way to the far south end.  

The Sewer Key unlocks this door which takes you of course, to more sewers. 
Stay on the east side if possible and you'll find a FIRST AID KIT on the 
ground at a dead-end.  Cross to the other side and climb up the ladder to 
reach the next section of the sewers.  Directly beside you in this new area is 
another FIRST AID KIT.  Head south and you'll come to a four way fork in the 
path.  Take the east branch and follow it all the way to the end where you'll 
find both a HEALTH DRINK and some HANDGUN BULLETS on the ground.  Go all the 
way south and at that point, start making your way west.  Proceed through 
every gate you come across until eventually you come to a dead end with some 
blood on the ground.  Examine the blood to get SEWER EXIT KEY.  Upon doing 
this three reptile things will attack you.  Don't waste your ammunition or 
health, just turn around and go through the gate back to the far east side.  
Use the Sewer Exit Key on the east door and save before climbing up again.

Listen closely because you don't have a map of this area.  You'll pop out of 
the sewer among some broken down concrete walls.  Head up past the ladder and 
turn left when you can (left from Harry's perspective.)  Turn left again and 
check inside this broken structure to find RIFLE SHELLS, HANDGUN BULLETS and a 
FIRST AID KIT.  Just outside of this structure on the side of the street is a 
sign with the RESORT AREA MAP attached to it, be sure to pick that up.  Head 
down to the end of Bachman Road and get on the south side of Sandford Street.  
Run along the south side moving west until you find a small set of broken 
stairs leading off the road down to a HEALTH DRINK and some RIFLE SHELLS.  
From what I can tell that's about all you're going to find in this area.

At this point there is a little sidequest available that will determine 
whether you get the good or bad ending.  It's quite simple really and only 
depends on whether you complete the quest or skip it.  There are more than 
just one good, and one bad ending in this game, but this is one of the primary 
deterministic factors.  Feel free to skip over the next section if you wish.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry enters the bar to find Michael Kaufmann wrestling 
  with a demon on the floor of the bar.  Harry shoots the demon and saves 
  Kaufmann's life.  Kaufmann thanks him and asks if he's found a way out, but 
  neither of them has.  Before Kaufman leaves Harry asks him if he knows a 
  girl named Alessa, but unfortunately, he's never heard of her.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Check the floor between the pool tables to find a package full of stuff.  
Inside is the KAUFMAN KEY and the RECEIPT.  Before you leave the bar also be 
sure to pick up the HEALTH DRINK and HEALTH DRINK sitting on the counter.  
There's also a Notepad there as well.  Leave the bar now and take a look at 
your map.  To the east there is a place called the Indian Runner.  That's 
going to be your next destination.  When you arrive and examine the door there 
will be a lock on it.  Open up your inventory and take a look at the receipt 
to find the number "0473" written on it, so use that.  This number opens up 
the lock for you.  Enter the Indian Runner and go around behind the counter to 
find some RIFLE SHELLS.  You'll find a HEALTH DRINK back there as well as a 
book sitting on the counter.  Read the book and then examine the drawer behind 
the counter to get the SAFE KEY.  Use the safe key to unlock the safe.  Inside 
you'll find drugs.  There's nothing at all you can do with them.  

Take a look at the white piece of paper beside the safe on the wall to get the 
code "0886" which will come in handy in a moment.  Leave the Indian Runner 
store and look at your map.  Locate the motel south of here and head there 
(the entrance to the motel is on the south side.)  The door you want is number 
three, use the Kaufmann Key to open it up.  Start by collecting the HEALTH 
DRINK off the counter in the bathroom.  What you need to do now is leave the 
motel inner area, and when you're back on the street check the east side of 
the motel (the back) to find a door.  The door is locked, but when you 
examine the key panel beside it you'll be able to enter a code.  Type in the 
code "0886" and then press the enter button to unlock the door.

Examine the newspaper on the coffee table to get a few more clues about what's 
going on.  Same applies to the documents on the desk in this room.  Pick up 
the MAGNET off of the couch and then go through the open door to find a 
Notepad where you can save your game.  The door beside the TV is jammed so try 
the one on the other side.  Pick up the HEALTH DRINK and SHOTGUN SHELLS, and 
then examine the old motorcycle.  Return to the room with the Notepad and 
unlock the front door, then go out that way.  Proceed back inside room number 
three which you unlocked before with the Kaufmann Key.  Push the shelving unit 
out of the way (examine it from the side) and then use your Magnet to pick up 
the MOTROCYCLE KEY.  Return to the motel office and use it on the motorcycle.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: Inside the motorcycle Harry finds a vial of liquid 
  similar to the liquid he found in the hospital.  Kaufmann suddenly enters 
  the room and grabs the liquid from him, he seems very angry demanding that 
  Harry stop wasting time and mind his own business if he wants to stay 
  alive.  Harry realizes that Michael Kaufmann was most likely involved in 
  all the drug activity that plagued the town earlier, but at the moment it's 
  not something to worry about. His daughter Cheryl is more important.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thus the Michael Kaufmann sidequest has been completed.  Your reward (besides 
the ending) is all of the items you wouldn't have been able to find otherwise, 
not that there was anything all that special.  Time to move onward.

Make your way to Sanford Street and then start heading west.  Once you get 
across the bride we start to phase into the alternate world once again.  Your 
destination now (take a look at your map) is the direction of the Lighthouse 
to the south.  We're not actually going to the Lighthouse yet, but as you move 
toward it you should come to a point where you have no choice but to take a 
few steps back and go down the stairs beside you.  Cross the board at the 
bottom and enter the houseboat.  Proceed through the door for a scene.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry finds Cybil in the houseboat, she says that she 
  made her way through the sewer to reach this point.  Harry explains the 
  situation to Cybil by saying the town is being "invaded by the Underworld, 
  trying to swallow up everything in darkness."  In addition to all this, he 
  knows that Cheryl is somewhere within the darkness and she needs his help.

  Suddenly Dahlia Gillespie bursts into the houseboat shouting her various 
  ramblings about the consumption of the town by the darkness.  Soon it will 
  be over, she says, with the completion of Samael's symbol.  Dahlia says 
  the only way to save everyone is to stop the demon, the demon taking the 
  child's form.  The Lighthouse on the lake, and the Amusement Park are the 
  final two locations.  Harry must go there now.  Cybil says she will head 
  for the Amusement Park while he goes to the Lighthouse.  Before going 
  Dahlia says that the only way to stop it is to use the Flauros, but what 
  of Cybil?  She doesn't have one... but it's too late, Dahlia is gone.
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS, RIFLE SHELLS and then HEALTH DRINK, then use the 
Notepad on the counter to save your game.  Leave the houseboat through the 
door that you didn't come in from, and then proceed toward the Lighthouse.  
The path takes you all over the place but don't worry, it's almost entirely 
linear.  Take a look at your map to see that the path going south sticks out a 
bit at the bottom, while earlier it turns east toward the Lighthouse.  If you 
pass by the stairs leading up at the corner and go all the way south you'll 
find a FIRST AID KIT on the ground.  Ascend the stairs and head east now and 
eventually after a lot of up and down running, you'll reach the Lighthouse.

Save your game using the Notepad at the entrance, and then climb up the long 
spiral stairs toward the top.  You're too late, and the young girl (Alessa) 
has already been here.  The mark of Samael is present in full force, perhaps 
you can get to the Amusement Park before it's too late?  Run down to the 
bottom of the stairs and exit the Lighthouse.  As you run forward you'll 
automatically find yourself transported back to the houseboat.  Since Cybil 
isn't there you've got to get to the Amusement Park fast.  Save your game and 
leave through the back door.  Head north again toward Sanford Street.  Take a 
look at your map and see the arrow on the other side of Sanford Street.  
You'll find an open gate just below it and another sewer access.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Cybil climbs up to the top of the ladder and looks 
  around.  Just then, something approaches and hits her from behind...

Make your way south until you come to a four way split at which point you need 
to turn and start going west.  At the next fork in the road go south where 
you'll find both HANDGUN BULLETS and a HEALTH DRINK on the ground.  There's a 
second health drink in the corner of the western branch.  Proceed north up the 
path and watch out for the new enemies, the Claw Demons.  At the third fork in 
the road.  Turn west again and follow this path until you reach the ladder.

There isn't a lot to this place, so little in fact that you won't even find a 
map.  Your main goal to start is to locate the concession stand.  The 
concession stand is a large structure with about three windows, two of them 
closed and one of them open with a Notepad to save your game.  After locating 
the Notepad, turn around and move in the exact opposite direction of the pad 
until you hit a dead end.  Turn right at that point and run a little bit to 
find the merry-go-round.  Open up the gate here to trigger a scene.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| What we have here is the second of two primary deterministic factors for ||
|| your ending.  The boss is Cybil and there are two ways to fight this     ||
|| battle, killing her or not killing her.  For the sadistics I'll start    ||
|| with the strategy for defeating Cybil as a boss.  Doing so will          ||
|| likely get you the bad ending (if you didn't do the Kaufmann sidequest)  ||
|| or the Good ending (killing her and doing the sidequest.)  Saving her    ||
|| (and doing the Kaufmann sidequest) should get you the best ending, so if ||
|| it's your first time through that's what you're probably going for.  The ||
|| first paragraph covers how to kill her, and the second, how to save her. ||
||                                                                          ||
|| Cybil is a relatively easy boss for the most part.  Her attacks are      ||
|| extremely powerful, but it's that fact that they're so easy to dodge     ||
|| that makes the fight easy.  She has two attacks, slap you and shoot you. ||
|| When you're right next to her she'll probably pistol whip you, otherwise ||
|| she'll just keep shooting and shooting until it's over.  When she shoots ||
|| her arms takes a moment to lift and when that happens, as long as you've ||
|| moving perpendicular (left or right, not toward her) at any speed you    ||
|| will be able to dodge the attack.  Strafing with R1 and L1 work too,     ||
|| although you should be holding square when you use those.  As for        ||
|| actually attacking, the close range Shotgun works best, but the Rifle is ||
|| probably the best choice overall.  Remember that you're stationary when  ||
|| attacking so this is definitely when you're most likely going to be      ||
|| hit.  Stay at a distance if you're using the Rifle and don't try to get  ||
|| off more than a shot or two before moving to dodge her attack.           ||
||                                                                          ||
|| Saving Cybil and aiming for the best ending is the best choice to make.  ||
|| Not only that, it also saves you from having to waste ammunition and     ||
|| you'll probably avoid quite a bit more damage.  In order to save her you ||
|| have to have collected the red liquid in the hospital using the Plastic  ||
|| Bottle.  If you've been following this guide to the letter then you      ||
|| definitely have it, if not then... you'll just have to kill her.  All    ||
|| you need to do is run up to Cybil as close as you can possibly get,      ||
|| perhaps even from behind, and then open your inventory and use the       ||
|| Plastic Bottle full of liquid.  The parasite will crawl out of her...    ||
||__________________________________________________________________________||
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: Assuming that you saved Cybil during the battle, Harry 
  squishes the parasite that was infecting her.  When Cybil has recovered 
  from the attack, she asks Harry if he knows why they took his daughter?  
  Harry explains that Cheryl wasn't actually his biological daughter, they 
  found her on the side of the road one day all alone and took her in.  
  Given this fact there's a chance there could be some connection between 
  Cheryl and Silent Hill.  Harry intends to save her no matter what.

  Alessa stands before Harry.  He demands that she let Cheryl go but Alessa 
  raises her arm and knocks him back with some kind of magic forcefield.  
  The Flauros that Dahlia gave him earlier rises from his hand and strikes a 
  blow to Alessa who screams and falls to the ground.  Harry approaches the 
  girl and Dahlia Gillespie walks out from the darkness.  She tells Alessa 
  (her daughter) to stop this game.  Dahlia speaks of a spell she used to 
  entrap Alessa, but somehow she was able to escape thanks to Harry Mason.  
  Dahlia tells Alessa that it's time to go home, and the two of them 
  disappear into some kind of portal, and once again Harry blacks out.

  THE STORY SO FAR: Harry wakes up with Lisa in the examination room from 
  the Alchemilla Hospital.  She says that after talking to Harry she went 
  down to look at the rooms down in lowest basement.  She got the feeling 
  that she had been there before, like something happened there and she 
  couldn't remember.  Harry tells her not to worry and that she'll remember 
  soon, but Lisa is angry, and storms out of the room on her own.  
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a Notepad on the table, I think that now would be a good time to save 
your game.  There is only one door leading out of this room, it takes you to a 
walkway and across into an elevator.  Nowhere is kind of like a combination of 
places you've been before, with sprinkles of novel-ness all over the place.  A 
very odd and creepy place all around.  Since you don't have a map make sure to 
listen close.  Head through the first door on your right and pick up the 
HANDGUN BULLETS off the table.  Leave the room and go right, the next door is 
locked but the one after it takes you into the Antique Shop.  Save your game 
(again) if need be and pick up both the FIRST AID KIT and SHOTGUN SHELLS that 
you find in this room.  Leave this room and continue down the hall.  The next 
two doors are locked but the third one after it is open, head inside.

Examine the lone desk in the middle of the classroom and then take the other 
door that you didn't come in from.  Pick up both the SCREWDRIVER and the 
PLIERS from off the table, and then backtrack up to the previous floor.  The 
door beside the double doors you entered from (Lisa's examination room) leads 
you into a small room with a lone faucet.  Examine the faucet and then use the 
PLIERS on it to get the KEY OF "OPHIEL."  Use the key to unlock one of the 
doors in the previous hallway, then go through it.  On your right is a new 
puzzle.  The only door in this hallway leads to an empty room with a second 
puzzle.  Ignore that second puzzle for now and focus on the one out in the 
hallway.  Examine the large gray tablet on the wall and it lists a bunch of 
names.  Read the large gray tablet at the end of the hall as well.  This one 
says something about the people lining up in order of age.  If you haven't 
figured it out by now go back and look at the first gray tablet.  What you 
need to do is look at the first letter of the people's first names in the 
ascending order of their age.  18 is Albert, so A.  When you do this is will 
spell the word "ALERT" and that just happens to be the door's code.  The 
password panel is the one on the right side of the door, input it there.

Through the door is an empty storage room.  Keep moving into the morgue and 
collect the AMULET OF SOLOMON from the wall.  When you go back into the 
previous room it will trigger another scene with Lisa.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: Lisa tells Harry she knows why her life has been spared, 
  but she doesn't want to be alone.  She cries out for Harry's help and runs 
  toward him, but Harry backs off.  Blood begins to pour down Lisa's face as 
  she cries and Harry closes the door ahead of her.  When he goes back 
  inside Lisa is gone and there's no trace of her body.  A diary lies in the 
  middle of the floor, the diary of someone who worked in the hospital, see 
  blood everywhere and being unable to endure it.  It ends with "Need drug."
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Re-enter the room and read the diary on the floor.  After reading it exit the 
room and go into the only other room that opens here.  People familiar with 
the astrology signs will be able to get this quite easily.  The solution is as 
follows: for the button on the left side press six, for the one in the middle 
press four and the one on the right press eight.  Doing so will release the 
STONE OF TIME.  Take the Stone of Time back into the previous hall and enter 
the Antique Shop.  Stand in front of the clock and use the Stone of Time to 
smash the glass covering the hands.  After doing that you can pick up the KEY 
OF "HAGITH."  The Key of "Hagath" unlocks the double doors at the end of the 
hall.  Go through them and then take the elevator to the second floor.

Try the third door on your left to find the Jewelry Shop.  There are a number 
of items to collect in here including the RING OF CONTRACT, CREST OF MERCURY 
and some RIFLE SHELLS.  Leave the room and go through the double doors at the 
opposite end of the hall.  Unlock the double doors ahead of you and you'll 
find they somehow take you back to the first floor hallway.  That's not where 
you want to go however, enter the room almost directly opposite the double 
doors which lead back to the first floor.  Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS off the 
table and snag the CAMERA as well.  Leave this room and go through the door at 
the top of the hall.  Examine the steel plate on the wall then open your 
inventory and use the Screwdriver.  Unfortunately there is no way for you to 
get this key right now so you've got no choice by to go back through those 
doors that lead to the first floor, and ride the elevator to floor three.

There is an altar here with two paintings on each side and two locked doors 
each with three panels on them.  What you need to do is approach the painting 
on the left and use the camera.  The camera will reveal three shapes.  
Reproduce these shapes on the left door using the panels to unlock it.  Next 
take a picture of the painting on the right and recreate those shapes on the 
right door to unlock it.  Proceed through the door on the right and pick up 
the HEALTH DRINK, then read the book beside it.  Look all around this room for 
any other articles you can read, there should be a couple.  Go through the 
door on the left this time and pick up the BIRD CAGE KEY off of the chair.  
Ride the elevator back down to the first floor and go through the door to the 
left of the examination room when facing the examination room (where you 
started this area.)  Use the Bird Cage Key on the bird cage to get the KEY OF 
"PHALEG."  Use that key on the door next to this one to reach the next area.

Watch out for invisible Demon Babies here, they're not harmless like the other 
ghosts.  If you're one of those people who uses the walkthrough as a rough 
guide and does their own thing, I highly recommend you don't touch the dagger 
in the room on the right.  Pulling it out will get you killed, I guarantee it.  
What you actually have to do is stand in front of the dagger and use the Ring 
of Contract to connect the broken link in the chain.  After doing that you are 
free to take the DAGGER OF MELCHOIR without being eaten.  Go into the room 
next to the kitchen and pick up the HEALTH DRINK and HANDGUN BULLETS.  There 
are some Jelly Beans on the shelf as well, choose to open the bag and then 
pick up the KEY OF "BETHOR" on the floor afterward.  Open up the double doors 
that lead into the adjacent room and use your Video Tape on the VCR there.  

Leave this room and go through the door in the middle on the other side of the 
hall.  You'll find the ghost of a young girl crying in here.  The only item 
you can find to pick up in here is the ANKH.  Back in the hallway again use 
the Key of "Bethor" on the locked door.  Examine the generator and cut the 
power.  What does this do you might ask?  Remember the electrified key?  
Return to the first floor hall and go through the double doors that warp you 
to the second floor.  Turn left and enter the room at the far end.  Take the 
KEY OF "ARATRON" off the wall and bactrack to the basement hallway again.   
There is one locked door at the end of the hall, open it up.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  THE STORY SO FAR: The scene shows a few men and Dhalia Gillespie huddled 
  over the body of someone lying in bed, presumably Alessa.  They say that 
  half the soul is lost and they would only be able to draw a minute amount 
  of power from the girl, but Dahlia believes that with a magic spell 
  perhaps more could be done.  The people and images fade away....
______________________________________________________________________________
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pick up the DISK OF OUROBOROS from the object beside the bed, this is the 
final of the five relics.  Leave the room and enter the one directly across 
from it, Alessa's Room.  Make sure to use the Notepad in here which is sitting 
on the desk.  Stand in front of the door and use the Disk of Ouroboros, the 
Ankh, the Dagger of Melchior, the Crest of Mercury and the Amulet of Solomon.  
Save your game once again and heal yourself before opening the door.  Most of 
the story events after this point are dependent on the ending, so I'll let you 
watch them yourself.  Following these you fight the final boss.
 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| There are two final bosses of this game, Samael and Alessa.  If you're   ||
|| going for the bad ending you'll fight Alessa while if you're going for   ||
|| the good ending you'll fight Samael.  The difference between the bosses  ||
|| is very minimal, Alessa just takes less shots to actually kill.  The     ||
|| weapon of choice for this battle is the Hunting Rifle of course, and     ||
|| here's what you need to do.  The boss' only attack is three very         ||
|| powerful blasts of electricity back to back to back.  There is a         ||
|| strategy which will allow you to win this battle without being hit,      ||
|| almost guaranteed.  Here's how it works: Equip the Hunting Rifle, aim up ||
|| and fire five shots into the boss.  I recommend you hold the L2 button   ||
|| as well to make sure you're actually hitting the boss (look for a small  ||
|| bit of blood when you shoot.)  After five shots hold the R1 button,      ||
|| square button and left on the D-pad simultaneously.  While holding these ||
|| buttons you should be strafing in circles.  This is the only surefire    ||
|| and easiest way of dodging every one of the electricity bolts, every     ||
|| time.  After the third one stop where you are and shoot five more Rifle  ||
|| Shells into the boss.  Repeat this process for about 25 shots to win.    ||
||__________________________________________________________________________||
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      Congratulations, you have completed the game.  Enjoy your ending!

(Tip: Watch the opening cutscene again after you have completed the game, 
depending on which ending there should be a slight chance when it starts.)

+-- LIZARD --------------------------------------------------------- 02.01 --+

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| The Lizard makes for a decent first boss, and he can actually be pretty  ||
|| tough if you don't know what you're doing.  If you do know what you're   ||
|| doing however he can be quite easy.  The trick is timing and agile       ||
|| movement.  The boss is fought in two "stages."  During the first stage   ||
|| his only attack is like a headbutt.  He'll wander around the area and    ||
|| nudge you with his face.  It takes at least three of these to bring you  ||
|| from green to yellow damage and at least four or five more before it     ||
|| actually kills you.  The danger is minimal but you still need to heal if ||
|| you start to get hurt.  What you want to do is whip out the Shotgun and  ||
|| start blasting the monster in the face.  Shoot a couple times and then   ||
|| reposition yourself if necessary.  After about four of five shells to    ||
|| the face, the monster will get angry and enter the second stage of the   ||
|| battle.  The only attack it has now is when it opens up its face and     ||
|| tries to eat you.  This is a far cry from its first attack, now you're   ||
|| looking at something which is an almost guaranteed one-hit kill.         ||
|| Fortunately there's an easy solution.  Get yourself in a position where  ||
|| you're facing the boss and he's facing you, but there is a lot of        ||
|| distance behind you.  Wait until the first sign he is going to open his  ||
|| mouth then hold down to start walking backward (don't hold square to     ||
|| hop, just walk backward.)  While walking you can shoot with slowing down ||
|| so blast a couple of Shotgun Shells into the beast's open mouth.  On     ||
|| normal difficulty you can actually fire two shots in a matter of         ||
|| seconds, and kill the boss with those two back-to-back blasts.           ||
||__________________________________________________________________________||
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-- LARVA ---------------------------------------------------------- 02.02 --+

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| Lying on the ground over in the corner of the area where you fight the   ||
|| boss is a fairly conspicuous HUNTING RIFLE.  Despite the novel-ness of   ||
|| this new gun, it's not the best tool for the job.  Equip the Shotgun in  ||
|| this scenario and get ready to blast this vile creature.  The way it     ||
|| works is that the Larva comes up out of the ground, shoots a toxic cloud ||
|| at you and then moves toward you.  If you're hit by the toxic cloud you  ||
|| take damage, if the boss runs into you, you take damage.  The best way   ||
|| to avoid the bosses attacks is to utilize the strafing power of the L1   ||
|| and R1 buttons.  Always keep moving or you'll be hit for sure.  When the ||
|| boss pops out of the ground, take a couple of second to get out of the   ||
|| way, but try your very best to stay as close as you can while still      ||
|| avoiding the attack.  The closer you are the more damage your Shotgun    ||
|| will do.  You can get off about two shots on average before the boss     ||
|| buries itself under the ground again.  Rinse and repeat until it's dead. ||
||__________________________________________________________________________||
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-- MOTH ----------------------------------------------------------- 02.03 --+

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| While the Moth is probably the most difficult boss you've faced so far,  ||
|| there's no reason a patient person can't get through this battle with    ||
|| little to do damage.  For those looking to go on an offensive, the       ||
|| Shotgun is the weapon of choice, while those who wish to avoid damage    ||
|| should opt for the Hunting Rifle.  The Moth has two basic attacks, a     ||
|| poison cloud spray from the air similar to the previous boss' attack,    ||
|| and a stab with its stinger that does a bit more damage than the former. || 
|| To avoid being hit by these attacks and still kill the boss you need to  ||
|| equip the Hunting Rifle and run back and forth from one side of the roof ||
|| to another between the furthest two points.  When you stop and turn      ||
|| around you will only have time to fire off one shot before you have to   ||
|| run back.  If you're willing to take at hit then you can probably get    ||
|| off about five or six shots before the Moth gets close enough to attack  ||
|| physically.  It takes a good 15 shots or so on the normal difficulty     ||
|| from various ranges to kill the boss, less with the close-range Shotgun. ||

+-- CYBIL ---------------------------------------------------------- 02.04 --+

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| What we have here is the second of two primary deterministic factors for ||
|| your ending.  The boss is Cybil and there are two ways to fight this     ||
|| battle, killing her or not killing her.  For the sadistics I'll start    ||
|| with the strategy for defeating Cybil as a boss.  Doing so will          ||
|| likely get you the bad ending (if you didn't do the Kaufmann sidequest)  ||
|| or the Good ending (killing her and doing the sidequest.)  Saving her    ||
|| (and doing the Kaufmann sidequest) should get you the best ending, so if ||
|| it's your first time through that's what you're probably going for.  The ||
|| first paragraph covers how to kill her, and the second, how to save her. ||
||                                                                          ||
|| Cybil is a relatively easy boss for the most part.  Her attacks are      ||
|| extremely powerful, but it's that fact that they're so easy to dodge     ||
|| that makes the fight easy.  She has two attacks, slap you and shoot you. ||
|| When you're right next to her she'll probably pistol whip you, otherwise ||
|| she'll just keep shooting and shooting until it's over.  When she shoots ||
|| her arms takes a moment to lift and when that happens, as long as you've ||
|| moving perpendicular (left or right, not toward her) at any speed you    ||
|| will be able to dodge the attack.  Strafing with R1 and L1 work too,     ||
|| although you should be holding square when you use those.  As for        ||
|| actually attacking, the close range Shotgun works best, but the Rifle is ||
|| probably the best choice overall.  Remember that you're stationary when  ||
|| attacking so this is definitely when you're most likely going to be      ||
|| hit.  Stay at a distance if you're using the Rifle and don't try to get  ||
|| off more than a shot or two before moving to dodge her attack.           ||
||                                                                          ||
|| Saving Cybil and aiming for the best ending is the best choice to make.  ||
|| Not only that, it also saves you from having to waste ammunition and     ||
|| you'll probably avoid quite a bit more damage.  In order to save her you ||
|| have to have collected the red liquid in the hospital using the Plastic  ||
|| Bottle.  If you've been following this guide to the letter then you      ||
|| definitely have it, if not then... you'll just have to kill her.  All    ||
|| you need to do is run up to Cybil as close as you can possibly get,      ||
|| perhaps even from behind, and then open your inventory and use the       ||
|| Plastic Bottle full of liquid.  The parasite will crawl out of her...    ||

+-- FINAL BOSS ----------------------------------------------------- 02.05 --+

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|
|| There are two final bosses of this game, Samael and Alessa.  If you're   ||
|| going for the bad ending you'll fight Alessa while if you're going for   ||
|| the good ending you'll fight Samael.  The difference between the bosses  ||
|| is very minimal, Alessa just takes less shots to actually kill.  The     ||
|| weapon of choice for this battle is the Hunting Rifle of course, and     ||
|| here's what you need to do.  The boss' only attack is three very         ||
|| powerful blasts of electricity back to back to back.  There is a         ||
|| strategy which will allow you to win this battle without being hit,      ||
|| almost guaranteed.  Here's how it works: Equip the Hunting Rifle, aim up ||
|| and fire five shots into the boss.  I recommend you hold the L2 button   ||
|| as well to make sure you're actually hitting the boss (look for a small  ||
|| bit of blood when you shoot.)  After five shots hold the R1 button,      ||
|| square button and left on the D-pad simultaneously.  While holding these ||
|| buttons you should be strafing in circles.  This is the only surefire    ||
|| and easiest way of dodging every one of the electricity bolts, every     ||
|| time.  After the third one stop where you are and shoot five more Rifle  ||
|| Shells into the boss.  Repeat this process for about 25 shots to win.    ||
