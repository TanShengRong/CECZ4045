Japanese cafes serving matcha desserts, matcha latte, Hojicha cakes and pancakes continue to be popular in Singapore. Other than Gram Cafe & Pancakes Singapore, Belle-Ville, Flippers is the next to arrive, set to open at Takashimaya.Let’s not forget about some of the home-grown brands we should be proud of, such as Hvala and Matchaya, both known for their matcha latte and desserts. Those in this list are a combination of 35 cafes (and more) that originate from Japan, feature Japanese style food and desserts, or are helmed by Japanese chefs – an update from the previous compilation. (There are some that we may not have included yet, as we prefer to add cafes we have personally visited before.)For your convenience, I have arranged them in alphabetical order. While the opening hours have been updated as of Oct 2020, do check with individual cafe’s as operational hours do change from time to time.% Arabica – Jewel Changi Airport

Baristart Coffee Singapore
65 Tras Street Singapore 079004 (Tanjong Pagar MRT)
Opening Hours: 9am – 9pm (Mon – Sun) Popular Hokkaido café Baristart Coffee has arrived in Singapore, and it is not difficult to understand why it would be a hit with both coffee and Japanese food lovers.Other than using Hokkaido milk of exceptional quality for its coffee, matched with beautiful latte art; its food and desserts – such as the Shiro Kuma Hokkaido shaved ice is worthy venturing to Tanjong Pagar for.It is the first café here to offer coffee using the popular Brown Jersey Milk from Biei, a small town in Hokkaido, Japan. Biei Jersey Milk is an ultra-premium milk prized for being rare, as there are only about 800 Brown Jersey cows left making up 1% of the total cow population in Japan.For a savoury treat, get the Tonkatsu Sando ($16.80). Baristart takes a Western diner classic and gives it a Japanese spin, using the popular Japanese breaded pork cutlet (tonkatsu) as a sandwich filling.The centimetre-thick meat coated in panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs) is well seasoned, deep fried to a crisp yet juicy inside. Baristart Coffee (Tras Street) Cafe Ma Maison
333A Orchard Road #02-33/34 Mandarin Gallery Singapore 238897
Tel: +65 6235 6411For those of you who remember, Café Ma Maison used to exist at Liang Court’s basement. The new space at Orchard Road replaces where gorgeous pastry shop Antoinette used to be.In terms of “Special Cakes”, there is an attractive display of Classic Strawberry Shortcake ($7.80), Chocolate Walnut ($7.80), Chocolate Strawberry Shortcake ($7.80), Earl Grey Tea ($7.80), Fresh Fruit Shortcake ($8.80), and Japanese Matcha Mousse & Red Bean ($8.80).While my heart told me to go for a Strawberry Shortcake, I thought it has become quite a regular offering in Singapore’s cafes and so opted for a more uncommon and colourful Fresh Fruit Shortcake.I loved the array of fruits of grapes, blueberries, kiwi, strawberries and oranges, in between moist yet flurry sponge. But my favourite part was still the light, airy cream.Also included is a small savoury items menu, with Omu-Katsu ($20.80) of Omu-Rice with Pork Cutlet, Truffle-Flavoured Katsu Sandwich ($14.80), and Mentaiko Spaghetti ($18.30).

Blk 490, Toa Payoh Lorong 6, #01-15, Singapore 310490
Opening Hours: 9am – 9pm (Mon – Sun)Japanese confectionary Châteraisé has been opening EVERYWHERE in Singapore, but this outlet at Toa Payoh incorporates a sit-down café concept.Their best seller is the “Legendary Strawberry Cream Cake” which boasts of light fresh cream and sweet strawberries. Other popular favourites include White Zebra Caramel (that’s like a Mille Crepe Cake), Green Zebra, Crispy Chocolate Cake, Fluffy Cream Rolls and animal-shaped ones.Daizu Cafe
129 Rangoon Road, Singapore 218407
Opening Hours: 10am – 10pm (Mon with coffee and cakes only), 10am – 10pm (Tue – Thu), 9am – 10pm (Fri – Sun)Daizu Cafe is the newest addition to the cafe scene along Rangoon Road.Their brunch menu featuring Daizu Brunch ($22) and Lemon Miso Egg Benedict ($24) is available daily from 11am to 3pm; whereas Rice Bowls ($14 – $17) and Udon ($16) are available from 11am till 3pm and 5pm onwards.I loved that there is a Petit Breakfast ($10) meant for smaller eaters, with chicken sausage and ultra-creamy scrambled eggs with brioche toast.Soybean powder is used to make the batter in some of their Japanese dishes such as the Kitsune Udon with Tempura Prawn ($16) and Chilli Soft Shell Crab Rice Bowl ($17).

Last order half hour before closingSeen those gravity-defying Japanese soft serve on social media?Popular Japanese brand Emma Soft Serve has opened its 2nd outlet in Singapore, sharing space with Menya Kokoro.Other than Boba Taco Softie ($6.80) or Okinawa Brown Sugar Boba Japanese Soft Serve in Wafer Shell, I would recommend the Charcoal Cheese in Charcoal Cone ($5.50).Think Japanese soft serve, topped with Okinawa brown sugar pearls and housed in crispy wafer taco shell.They have also introduced new Japanese-style bubble tea range with a difference. The drinks are also included with “Kuromitsu” which literally translates to “black honey” – a thin and dark syrup made from Japanese unrefined kurozato (“black sugar”) often used in the making of Japanese sweets.  You would also find that the chewiness and sweetness of the boba pearls are unlike the usual. That is because “Okinawa brown sugar pearls” are used, cooked with a combination of Okinawan brown sugar and kuromitsu which gives it a distinctive caramelised-sweetness. Emma (Plaza Singapura)Fine Dining Bakery
207 River Valley Road, 01-59 UE Square, Singapore 238275
Opening Hours: 9am – 3pm (Mon, Thurs – Sun), Closed Tues, WedYou would find many Japanese expats and ladies hanging around the café, and find that some of the recommended breads are quickly snapped up.The head baker Chef Maekochi’s or “Akira” used to work at La Boutique de Joël Robuchon in Roppongi, Joël Robuchon at Resorts World Sentosa, and béni Singapore. That’s why the name of “fine dining bakery” due to his experience. The bakery café specialises in handcrafted breads using Hokkaido flours, and baked throughout the day in small quantities so that the goods stay fresh. Its signature is the Shokupan White Bread – deliciously soft and fluffy that may just transport you to Japan. You would also find the bread used for sandwiches such as the Fluffy Egg Salad Sandwich ($8.50).Flipper’s Singapore (Opening Nov 2020)
Flippers will make its debut in Southeast Asia with a flagship store at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, Ngee Ann City this November.The brand that originated in Tokyo in 2014 is a cult favourite that trailblazed the soufflé pancake trend in Japan.Flippers is known for its inimitable kiseki or ‘miracle’ pancake which is fluffy, pillow-soft and melt-in-the-mouth. Each artisanal soufflé pancake is made using a precise recipe. The soufflé pancakes are so delicate that they are served with two forks as part of the experience.The Singapore flagship store will offer both sweet and savoury favourites from Flipper’s classic menu. Flippers FLOR Capitol

Tel: +65 6977 7202
Opening Hours: 11am – 7pm (Tues – Sun), Closed MonFans of Japanese-style cakes and pastries should be familiar with FLOR Patisserie Café which has two branches at Duxton Hill and Siglap Drive.It has recently opened its 3rd outlet with a slightly different concept, FLOR Capitol at Capitol Singapore (formally known as “Capitol Piazza”).Something to note: This is the first FLOR Patisserie Café to feature freshly made desserts, and some of the recommended include the Signature Roll ($6 for slice, $22.45 for whole), Tiramisu in a Glass ($12), Warm Blueberry Pie with ice cream ($12), and Gula Melaka Crème Caramel ($10).The one thing to get is the Gula Melaka Brown Sugar Roll Cake ($6) in which you can enjoy the interplay of play of two complex sugars in a single cake. And thankfully light and not too sweet as well.In terms of texture, the sponge layer was fluffy and soft, while the cream inside was smooth and not too heavy. All in all, a delicious soft roll cake. FLOR Capitol (Capitol Piazza)Gram Café & Pancakes Singapore
VivoCity #02-110/111, 1 Harbourfront Walk, Singapore 098585
Opening Hours: 11am – 10pm (Mon – Sun)You may have seen videos of Gram’s Pancakes which made their way around social media, of stacks of 3 pancakes being ‘shaken’ on plates.Gram is famous for its 3-stacked “Premium Pancakes”, each 4 cm thick, served with syrup, butter and whipped cream.In Singapore’s outlet, they are sold at $17.90 for the stack of three.

Henri Charpentier Singapore

Tel: +65 6634 4608
Opening Hours: 11am – 10:30pm (Mon – Sat), 11am – 10pm (Sun)Henri Charpentier’s Strawberry Short Cake was actually crowned “Best Short Cake” in Japan on a well-known Japanese television programme. This is also its Number 1 best seller in Singapore.Compared to other cakes, the whipped fresh cream filling has a richer milk taste, but is still melt in your mouth. The sponge was just slightly on the dry side for me, but overall a delightful version.Other popular cakes include Mille Crepe ($9.60), Double Cheesecake ($8.50), Tiramisu ($9.60), Lemon Tart ($7.50), Chocolatine ($10.20), and Classic Souffle Cheesecake.Hoshino Coffee

CHIJMES, 30 Victoria Street, Singapore 187996
Opening Hours: 11am – 9:30pm (Mon – Sun)A Japanese teahouse located within the walls of the 19th-century built chapels at CHIJMES. (There are also outlets at
TripleOne Somerset and Keong Saik.)The space has a minimalist touch with wooden elements incorporated into every single details, yet brought out the beauty and the simplicity in the design. (Reminds me of Peace Oriental Teahouse from Bangkok.)The tea apparatus and tableware are all neatly displayed at the bar counter, from the mini stone mill grinder, pour over apparatus, tea scoop to the whisk.This is probably the best spot to witness all the actions and effort in preparing every cup of tea, with an expanded space, and certainly feels more “zen” now. Hvala (CHIJMES)Japan Rail Café
5 Wallich Street, #01-20/21 Tanjong Pagar Centre, Singapore 078883 (Tanjong Pagar MRT)
Opening Hours: 11am – 9pm (Mon – Thurs), 11am – 9:30pm (Fri, Sat), 11am – 8pm (Sun, PH)Rail pass ticketing, retail and Japanese style cafe. This is the first overseas venture by East Japan Railway Company, located on Level 1 of Tanjong Pagar Centre.Walking in, the first thing you may notice is a convenient rail ticket service for Japan rail passes.Food wise, the menu did feel rather ‘Western-Japanese’, with a selection of burgers ($19 – $22), sandwiches ($15 – $18) and rice plates ($16 – $18). There is a selection of pastries from Asanoya Bakery.JW360° (Japan Way Three Sixty)

If you are a sweet tooth or just needing a tea break while walking around Jewel Changi Airport, the JW360° café corner is for you.They have a range of cakes and gelato, with matcha and sakura specials, using Japanese ingredients like matcha, adzuki bean, and wasanbon, an expensive fine-grained Japanese sugar made from Shikoku sugarcane.The must-get is the Japanese Gelato ($7.50) with 2 flavours topped with sweet potato. Flavours include Japanese Whiskey, Caramel Walnut, Soba-Cha (interesting), Matcha Milk, Sweet Potato, Hoji-cha and Black Sesame.The Goma I dare say with its rich and intense flavour, is possibly THE BEST black sesame gelato I had in Singapore.The picturesque Matcha Mont Blanc ($9.00) with Japanese chestnut paste is my personal favourite; while Matcha Mille Feuille ($9.00) with matcha butter, custard and sweet chestnut are both art-on-a-plate. JW360° (JEWEL Changi Airport)Kagurazaka Saryo 神楽坂茶寮
VivoCity, 1 Harbourfront Walk, #01-59, Singapore 098585
Opening Hours: 11:30am – 10pm (Mon – Sun)Known to have 9 outlets in Japan with 14 years of history, Kagurazaka Saryo has opened its very first flagship store right in Singapore at VivoCity.Brought into Singapore by Japan Food Holdings who owns eateries such as Ajisen Ramen, they have replaced existing Fruit Paradise outlet (Oh bye bye, Fruit Paradise!) with Kagurazaka Saryo.Fans of fruit tarts from Fruit Paradise need not worry as the tarts are still available for purchase in slices or in whole at Kagurazaka Saryo.The menu offers a selection of signature matcha desserts such as their famed Matcha Fondue with Assorted Sides ($14.90) and Matcha Frozen Smores ($9.90).However, the matcha ice cream was milky and sweet, and the taste of green tea was not as distinct as expected, especially when this brand is supposed to comes from the land of matcha. Kagurazaka Saryo 神楽坂茶寮  (Vivocity)Kamome Bakery かもめベーカリー
Goldhill Shopping Centre, 169 Thomson Road Singapore 307621
Opening Hours: 8am – 7pm (Mon – Sun)Japanese Bakery-Café At Novena
Kamome Bakery is a new Japanese bakery-café at Goldhill Shopping Centre, located near Novena MRT Station.There are a couple of varied sandwich choices of Meat Loaf ($5.80), Croquette ($5.20), Tonkatsu ($5.60).Breads are quite uniquely-Japanese, with the offering of Red Bean & Butter, Teriyaki Chicken Pizza, Yuzu Chestnut, Dark Cherry Tart, Cinnamon Roll, Banana Brown Sugar – all priced from $3 to $5 thereabout.The Japanese Red Bean with salted butter bun was a moderate delight with its smooth paste and thick slab of butter. Kamome Bakery (Goldhill Shopping Centre)Kurasu
261 Waterloo Street #01-24 Singapore, Singapore 180261
Opening Hours: 8:30am – 5:30pm (Mon – Sun)When you talk about one of the best coffee shops in Singapore, Kurasu should be a shoo-in with its stringent roasting practices, aromatic coffee, and minimalist lifestyle approach.Kurasu, which means “to live” or “lifestyle” in Japanese, started off as a Japanese homeware store in Australia. It eventually led to a retail space in owner Yozo Otsuki’s hometown, Kyoto in 2016. The brand focuses on both the Japanese coffee culture and being a one-stop provider for Japanese coffee equipment.Upon walking into the new outlet at Waterloo Street (it moved from Odeon Towers), you get that simple-homely and Japanese-style minimalist (better if it is not so crowded and thus echoey), with a coffee table to witness the hand pour process, and several sofa seats for a cozy feel.A popular drink is the Matcha Latte Espresso ($7.50, same price for hot and iced) otherwise known as “Dirty Matcha” is a combination of sweet matcha and latte – so there is a good balance of both. Kurasu (Waterloo)Kyushu Pancake Singapore – Holland Village

Opening Hours: 11am – 9pm (Tues – Sun), Closed MonJapanese Pancake Cafe At Holland Village
Kyushu Pancake which used to be at Novena Regency, has reopened again at a different location – Holland Village.Wondering what to get? Some of the top-sellers include Berry-licious Pancake ($16.90), Matcha Tiramisu ($16.00), and Matcha MontBlanc ($18.00), and Annou Imo Pancakes (16.00).There are also savoury options of Eggs Benedict ($18.00), Croque Madame Pancake ($19.00), and American Big Breakfast ($22.00).The Kyushu Pancake Mix is made from 7 different finely selected grains including wheat from Oita Prefecture and Pressed barley from Saga Prefecture, 100% homegrown in Kyushu Japan, free of emulsifier, artificial fragrance, additives or processed starch.Therefore, the texture may not be the usual souffle and wobbly that many Singaporeans are more used to. Kyushu Pancake (Holland Village)LUNA Patisserie
53 Amoy Street Singapore 069879
Opening Hours: 12pm – 6:30pm (Mon – Fri), 12pm – 4pm (Sat – Sun)LUNA, the patisserie down Amoy Street spoiling customers with its mouth-watering cakes and pastries, has launched a number of new cakes in their menu.My personal recommendations would be the 2 NEW Japanese inspired cakes of Houjicha Tiramisu (inspired by the trending waterfall cake), and Goma Kinako Mochi Roll.For the Hojicha Tiramisu ($8), you get traditional Italian dessert tiramisu meeting hojicha, an aromatic Japanese roasted green tea, to fill in for this coffee-less treat. What I need to mention though, is that the tiramisu comes wrapped with a plastic sheet. Once removed, be prepared for a ‘waterfall’ of the lava top later.Also available on the menu are the Matcha White Chocolate ($8), Vanilla Cheddar Cheese ($7.50), Carrot Cream Cheese ($8) and assorted seasonal tarts and pastries such as the current-trending Korean-inspired Mentaiko Garlic Cream Cheese Bread ($6) and Truffle Garlic Cream Cheese Bread ($6). LUNA Patisserie (Amoy Street)Matchaya – The Cathay
The Cathay, #01-08/09, 2 Handy Road, Singapore 229233
Opening Hours: 10am – 10pm (Mon – Sun)Matchaya is a Japanese tea shop serving authentic Japanese-inspired beverages and sweets. They started off at ICON Village, but moved to The Cathay with bigger seating area of 18 seats, and an impressive menu offering more than 80 items.All premium ingredients, such as matcha and houjicha, are painstakingly sourced from different prefectures in Japan and blended exclusively. Hand-brewed from their own sources of tea, the Matchaya Exclusive Blend which is a bottled Japanese Milk Tea is a crowd favourite. The expanded menu includes Sandwiches ($6.90 – $8.90), Kiaseki- style Mains ($13.90 – $16.90), Drinks ($5 – $8), Ice Cream ($5.90 – $8), Parfaits ($8.50 – $14.90), Kakigori ($14.90) and Cakes ($6 – $9).The crowd favourite is the Koicha Azuki Roll Cake ($6) made with generous amount of ceremonial matcha and Chantilly cream, Azuki red beans and 100% activated charcoal sponge cake.Moist and fluffy on the outside, yet oozing with rich and distinctive matcha cream, I would say possibly worth the calories.

This Japanese-inspired sandwich features a hearty ebi katsu, made from chunky pieces of lightly-breaded deep-fried prawns. Two grilled slices Hokkaido milk bread keep the thick and juicy patty in place, accompanied with crunchy coleslaw to balance the textures. Enjoy this signature dish with a side of house greens and crisp shoestring potato fries. They also serve up Matcha Milk Bubble Tea. Miam Miam @ Bugis Junction

53 Tras Street, #01-01, Singapore 078992
Opening Hours: 12pm – 9:30pm (Fri – Sat), 12pm – 5:30pm (Sun)“Nesuto” means “Nest” in Japanese. The interior is painted in pastel pink and white, giving a sense of comfort and minimalism which could be a pull-factor for the tai-tais and OLs for an afternoon respite.Signaure cakes include the Yuzu Raspberry, Konichiawa Hojicha, Japanese Matcha Azuki, Japanese Goma, and C3 Cheesecake.I couldn’t keep my eyes off the ‘attention-seeking’ Yuzu Raspberry Cake ($9), coated with a bright pink whipped ganache.While the portion of the cake might seem bigger than the rest, the Japanese sponge was extremely light and fluffy, perhaps like biting through cotton.Made with yuzu meringue mousse and chunks of fresh raspberries, the citrusy and tanginess of the fruits cut through entire combination, making the cake light and refreshing.

Opening Hours: 10am – 11pm (Mon – Sun)Perhaps you may remember “Hattendo”, the once-trending Japanese cream buns which had long queues outside its café at Tanjong Pagar Centre. That café may have closed, but they have returned with a brand new “PIPES by Hattendo” concept at Dorsett Residences, very near Outram MRT Station.During the day there is a Japanese-fusion menu along with the signature cream buns; while night time customers can expect chef’s speciality dishes.The lunch time menu includes a variety of items such as Tamago Sand ($13) of egg mayo sandwich with sausage and green salad, Teriyaki Pork Chop Don ($14), Roast Bee Don ($18), Una Don ($25), Roast Beef Sourdough Toast ($14), to Spanish Pork Belly Burger ($8).

Opening Hours: 11am – 10pm (Mon – Sun)Maccha House specialises in traditional Maccha beverages and desserts created from this fine green tea powder, all sourced from Kyoto Japan.While they also serve hot food items, most are really here for their desserts, such as the Maccha Soft Serve Anmitsu with Rice-flour Dumplings, and Maccha Parfaits which come with rice flour, chocolate or soy milk pudding. While the palm-sized Maccha Tiramisu ($7.99) seems ordinary, it contained a layer of premium Kyoto’s “Morihan” matcha powder with more than 170 years of history, carefully dusted on top.They serve the Hot Maccha drink the traditional way – whisked with a bamboo chasen out of a bowl. Their Maccha Latte is considerately not as bitter, so some may like this version? Maccha House (Orchard Central)Nana’s Green Tea Café
The Atrium @ Orchard, Plaza Singapura 68 Orchard Road #03-80/82 Singapore 238839 (Dhoby Ghaut MRT) Tel: +65 6684 4312
Opening Hours: 11am – 9:30pm (Mon – Sun)With more than 30 branches in Japan, Nana Green Tea is sometimes termed as the “Japanese Starbucks”. Although Nana’s Green Tea is known to be a café, it also sells several main courses such as dons, udons and sushi rolls, with a more localised menu quite unlike the ones in Japan.Desserts such as its Matcha Anmitsu ($8.80), are definitely its strength. It may not blow you away but makes a decent afternoon tea-time treat, with its azuki red bean paste smooth and satisfying. Omotesando Koffee

Parkland Green @ ECP 920, East Coast Parkway #01-09/10, Singapore 449875
Tel: +65 6342 1786
Opening Hours: 12pm – 10pm (Mon – Thurs), 12pm – 11pm (Fri), 9am – 11pm (Sat), 9am – 10pm (Sun)Japanese dessert Café Saint Marc has a few star items – Choro Cro pastry, Little Fuji and Geisha Waffle Cone. No doubt, I am a fan.Few would know they opened a restaurant concept with much larger space at Parkland Green, East Coast Parkway. Dining at a Japanese café by the beach sounds like a great weekend activity. However, while The East Coast St. Marc may provide a fuller menu, the experience at other branches felt better.

9 Raffles Boulevard, #01-96 Millenia Walk, Singapore 039596
Opening Hours: 7am – 8:30pm (Mon – Fri), 9am – 7:30pm (Sat – Sun)Pullman Bakery, famous for their Hokkaido curry buns and other Danish pastries, is a name that Japanese bread lovers should recognise.Do you know that it first started off as “Tachihara Bakery” way back in 1978 in Hokkaido Japan?I noticed that there is matcha in EVERY section of the menu, and ordered the Matcha Cream Toast ($3), Ice Matcha Latte ($4.50), and Matcha Cup Dessert ($3).The Ice Matcha Latte ($4.50) was relatively sweet, overpowering everything else. As a matcha lover, I would have preferred more distinct notes of green tea. Tachihara Coffee (Millenia WalkTsujiri
6 Eu Tong Sen St, Clarke Quay Central #01-74, Singapore 059817
Opening Hours: 11am – 11pm (Mon – Sun)Probably one of the most known Japanese green tea café in Singapore. Tsujiri is said to be a 155-year-old traditional Japanese tea brand serving the highest quality Matcha with a contemporary twist. However, do not confuse them with Japan’s Gion or Saryo Tsujri – which the Japanese are more familiar with.The O-Matcha Latte ($5.60, $6.20) is a customer favourite, made using matcha harvested from Tsujiri’s own plantation in Uji, Kyoto. I found the latte slightly sweeter than the usual Japanese style, but was still a smooth, refreshing drink. They used to have more outlets in Singapore, but the one left now is at Clarke Quay Central.Other Related Entries
