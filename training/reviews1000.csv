  I purchased this bad boy for my wife’s home office. Let me start off by saying this thing shreds harder than Andy Brinker from the 1998 classic film Brink. For those of you who don’t know, this 99 min film introduced some of the most unique roller blade shredding ever witnessed. Purchase this and you can be shredding like Andy in no time!Update** after using the the shredder my wife has been walking around the house being very confrontational. She now says things like “Bruh, do you even shred!?” For this reason I have to deduct one star.

  basically, when i put the ""on/off"" switch on ""auto"", it runs continuously, whether I am feeding paper into it's mouth or not. It did work fine for the first few months after i got it. After the switch broke ( I am assuming that's what happened, but I am not an electrical engineer), I just continued to use it and turn it off and on manually. I would like it replaced and if you want the broken one back, please send me a label...though, I don't have a box big enough for it. Please advice.  Thank you.

  This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,

   PROS: I want to cover first the high-quality and well-built aspects of this paper shredder. I’ve seen other reviews I personally think the garbage can (bottom portion/ container) is well-built. It had zero problem shipping to me in one piece. I’ve tested and this can easily shred 15 to 16 pieces of normal copy paper and probably 12 of the thicker resume paper. Personally I use this to shred cardboard. (with all the boxes that I get from Amazon and/or for business it’s a great for shredding cardboard) and compost it afterwards. If you see in the video and photo attached the shredder has no problem going through very thick cardboard whatsoever.  Think “A hot knife through butter”. I also want to say that the machine is extremely quiet in comparison to other shredders a have owned or currently own. I’ve seen on other reviews people said it was loud. It obviously isn’t going to be silent. Even in comparison to the Amazon basics 8 sheet shredder, it’s about half as quiet as that. That link is below if you don’t need something this heavy-duty as the 12 sheet.Link to the AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper, CD and Credit Card Home Office Shredder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN9NX0I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BlQDDbTFVANXGCONS: My two issues with this shredder. One the bottom canister or garbage can cannot be replaced because of the safety mechanism that is built into the shredder. I realize it’s put there for safety but it’s kind of a pain if it ever cracks or breaks. Two is the opening only measures about 8.75-9 inches. If a larger amount of paper or cardboard is loaded in and isn't square to the opening it can jam. That’s easily resolved with the reverse button on the top of the shredder. I would link to see this same shredder with a 12 inch opening.Bottoms line is I would buy again or recommend to a friend.If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.

  I have gone through two of these now. The first one seemed decent and I blame myself for overworking it one day.  The second one, however, I barely used and was extremely careful in how many documents I put in at once.  This one died after a few months with no warning. It is plugged into a surge protector with other items that still work so it was not a power fluctuation. It was just dead one day with no power or sign of life at all. I am annoyed because it was clearly a defective unit but I am outside any return window.

  I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!

   This shredder works as advertised. In the attached video you can see it shredding a stack of 15 pages of paper, a CD, and a credit card. All seemed to work without incident. As you can see in the video it creates small cross shredded strips that will make reassembly of the original document more difficult. Stacks of documents will compress into thick strips that require some effort to separate.I would like to see paper bags or something to go in the wastebin as I would like to send the shredded material out to recycling without the having to dump it into another bag later.Currently the device has a bit of an oily / burnt smell but I have a feeling that it's lubricant from the factory. I expect that to dissipate and will report back if it does not. I will also report back on any long term issues I have with it.

  Over the years I've used a full-size shredder, a micro-shredder, and now this guy. So far, this is the best one.For starters, if you want a continuous-usage shredder you're not going to find it here. If you need to shred for hours and hours spent the cash for a commercial-strength full-size shredder. If, on the other hand, you're occasionally shredding a contract or credit card statement, this will do the trick nicely.I put this shredder through it's paces immediately upon receiving it, because I bought it to shred a large stack of papers I needed to shred to free up some space (tax returns, credit card statements, etc). The device is POWERFUL for it's size. It's blades are small but mighty. Seriously, you can hear this thing rev up like a little jet engine ready to gobble paper up. You CAN overload it with continuous 6-sheet shreds (it's a bad idea to shred a lot of multi-paper jobs at the max thickness a shredder is rated for), but if you let it breath a little between jobs and only feed it a few pages at a time, it handles it nicely.I expected the device to jam after shredding this huge stack of papers and it did, but I was able to clear it without too much trouble (I wish the opening was a little wider so I could easily pull out stuck paper with needle-nose pliers, but that's the only flaw in the device I found). A few minutes of reverse, forward, reverse, and a few yanks with the pliers and the one jam cleared without further issue.The real nice thing is that this device seems to handle paperclips just fine, and has a nice size waste bin for a product in this low price range.Well, there you have it. I was expected a piece of junk in this price range for very small jobs, and was overjoyed to find this device a step up. It has plenty of power, and shreds beautifully. Just don't try to run it for an hour shredding construction paper, folders, and 6 pages at once. Feed it a few pages at a time or one thick piece at a time and let it cool down every few minutes, and it should last you a good long time. Or at least longer than my last mini-shredder did. That thing is toast.

  ​I purchased this shredder 3 months ago. Love it!I was looking for something basic for my home office.Pros: - Instead of cutting vertically (""strip-cutting""), this shredder chops the sheets both horizontally and vertically (""cross-cut""). Instead of having some long spaghettis of papers, you get some little pieces of spaghettis, much harder for somebody to infer the original content. - Automatic mode: the shredder starts automatically when you insert a sheet (you can disable this behavior). It will stop on its own if you don't insert anything else. - The security trigger locks the shredder as soon you remove the head from the bin. - It doesn't take much room. - Transparent window to see through to know when to empty the bin. - Not noisy.Cons: Nothing for now.Notes:Avoid plastic envelopes/papers. I tried to shred an envelope made of plastic. Pieces of plastic got stuck inside of the blades. It took me 20 minutes to get it clean. That's when the ""reverse"" feature comes handy.I would recommend this item if you need something basic for daily use. If you want something for multiple people, I would go for something bigger.​

  I shred junk mail like it's a part time job. Seriously, someone must've been trolling my family and I and signed us up for every freakin' mailer available to my area and a few randos for good measure.Still living pre-00's and have wall to wall carpeting everywhere? No problem! Little wheels work on my slightly shaggy carpet no problem. YAY!The unit is quite tall but fits comfortably under my desk and it's not that high, maybe a tad higher than your average banquet table. Bonus: You can sit your lazy bum in your computer chair and not have to bend so far to feed the shredder. I say that's a win any day.Best quality: It's QUIET. Didn't realize how loud and rumbly my 3-ish year-old Walmart special was until I plugged in this guy. Super happy about that! No longer scaring my poor hamster with the shredder from hell.All in all so far it's a great product!

  Returned after three days. It had the worst time trying to shred 8 pieces of paper, and eventually broke after about 100 pieces of paper. Purchased a Fellowes instead. First time Amazon Basics has let me down.

  After my last shredder bit the dust, I started the unenviable task of looking for a new one.  I've had 5-6 shredders over the years, and while they have gotten better over time, I always end up paying quite a bit for a higher end personal shredder because I've had 2 cheaper ones early on that didn't last.  Even the better, more expensive ones, always struggled to shred the amount of pages they were rated for and had troubles keeping up (I batch shred, I don't have space to keep a shredder plugged in and ready all the time).I was happy to see that Amazon added some shredders to their Basics line.  The Basics line always seems to have great value and decent products.  I purchased this 8 sheet cross-cut shredder for less than half of what I believe I would have purchased a good 'name brand' model for.So far, it's been really good.  I like the simplicity of the shredder unit sitting on top of the waste can portion where the shredded bits go (I've been used to shredders with pull out shred bins that always made a mess and always got bits of paper crammed everywhere inside).  As with any shredder, I basically half the page rating and never put in more than half (in this case with a rating of 8, I never put in more than 4 layers), and it's been doing very well.

  I like this product as much as one can like a shredder. It works as advertised and was priced competitively. The one part of the machine I do not care too much for is the switch...as I tend to like to leave electric devices in the off position, I need to keep pushing the switch to off or on...a minor inconvenience, but an on/off switch would make this a better product. The switch now has all of the modes of operation in a row.

  I give all products a 3 rating unless I’m exceptionally impressed with them. I purchased this for home n procrastinated to the point of having 3 bins to empty. So far the pros: while I’d never try to put 15 sheets in at once it did multiple thick envelopes with the staples as well. No problem with credit cards. Def very good tiny cross cuts. Also it can run for 45 min before having to cool down. Unlike others I looked at that were similar n only ran for 3-5 mins n need 45 min cool down. Im very pleased. As far as the cons go I’ve noticed most reviews say how these make it a day or two after their warranty n break. I bought an addl 5 yr warranty for like 7$ or something. So if it lasts on it’s own longer than warranty I’ll change score

  Update: After over a year, the shredder is still working great. I use this in my kitchen to shred junk mail or anything with my address. It will zip through a typical 3 to 4 page credit card solicitation in seconds. A few staples are no problem either. If you put more than 6 pages, the motor bogs down but will slowly chew through it- I've done that a few times where it just stopped. There is a reverse switch to unclog it if you get overzealous in your shredding. It is usually faster to just put 3 pages in at a time. It has a credit card slot and has no problem chopping them up. There is a safety switch on the back that only allows the shredder to work while in the supplied can (this prevents chopped fingers if you don't unplug it while cleaning the teeth out; BUT if you want to shred into a bigger container, you aren't able to.)Great deal on a cross-cut general purpose shredder. In this day and age, there is no excuse for not making sure your personal information is secure. No paper/junk mail/etc goes in my trash without going through this shredder first.

  Quiet machine with ample capacity both in number of sheet at a time and duty time.  The bin for chads is more than adequate for large shredding parties.  The machine is heavy (it should be) and very stable.  I would buy this again and again.  BTW it does a goos job of shredding old CD's, ( I had some old tax records on them.) But, who has CD's anymore? If you are wondering, the chads are small enough for security purposes.  Besides once you shred 10 sheets everything is so commingled no one is stealing your info.Update: I’ve shredded at least 10 bankers boxes of old taxes, military records, estate papers, etc.  I ate them all including numerous CD’s with files and a few credit cards.  The chads are small so no one will be able to read anything off of them.  I like the size of the bin, in daily household use you shouldn’t have to empty it but once a month.  I think the product would be great for 5 or 6 person office too.

  This shredder jammed after two weeks of occasional home use and no longer works. I was careful not to put more than 10 pages at a time, and I stopped whenever the light indicated it was overheated.  The paper became stuck in the blades and it will not work, either reverse or forward.  The bit is constructed such that you cannot take it apart.  As the instructions indicated for a severe jam, I tried to put shredder oil in the blades, waited 30 minutes and tried again.  Nothing.  I will be sending this back and buying a different brand.

  I have purchased several different items under the ""Amazon Basics"" branding,and have been impressed by the quality of the items for what you pay for them. This shredder is no different. Great quality at a very economical price! The shredder is listed as a 12 sheet, but I kept my paper feed to 8 sheets or less as most bank and credit card statements are in that range.The instructions state that you should give the shredder a 30 minute break after about 7 minutes of continuous run, but this little shredder kept going and going!I filled the 4 gallon bin over a dozen times in less than 3 hours (I was WAY behind on my shredding duties!), and this little workhorse did not overheat or jam once.FIVE STARS for this wonderful shredder!PROS:* Great price for a 12 sheet crosscut shredder* Very simple to use - sliding switch for OFF, FORWARD (continuous), REVERSE (continuous), and AUTO (runs as fed paper)* Indicator lights to show if shredder is on (green), full, misaligned, or overheated (red)* Auto shutoff if overheating to protect motor.* Quiet operationCONS:None that I can speak of!RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USERS:* Be kind to your shredder! If you are shredding heavy, stop at half basket intervals (or when you hear the shredder slowing down), unplug the shredder, lift the head off the basket, and clear the shredded paper. It keeps the shredder working at optimal speed.* I highly recommend that you also purchase the 'Amazon' branded 'lubricating / sharpening sheets'.. They are easy to use (just shred one after every 30 minutes of service, and then activate the 'reverse' function for 10 seconds). This will keep you shredder's blades sharp and lubricated and protect your investment.SUMMARY:I highly recommend this shredder. Amazon also offers a 6 or 8 sheet shredder, but I think the 12 sheet model is worth the extra $10-$15, especially if you are shredding stuff like credit card offers without even opening the envelope. I'm not sure that the 6 or 8 sheet models would handle that task as quickly, and when it comes to shredding, I just want to get it done without delays or jams.For anyone considering this shredder, I hope this information has been helpful! Peace.

  I purchased this immediately after returning Amazon's more basic version because I was afraid the documents weren't being destroyed enough. This unit certainly met me expectations for that. See photo for average shredded profile. Unfortunately the 'Auto' featured failed within a few weeks. And finally 3 years later the until will no longer operate. Light use, usually only 1-3 sheets at a time. Maybe once a month. My other complaint would be that the credit card slot is completely the wrong direction as it allowed the entire card number to but output when shredded given the direction and shredded profile. Works great for most documents and credit/debit cards if turned 90 degrees to separate all numbers.

  Will only give it 3 stars, since it arrived broken. The reason for breakage was that the little plastic  tab attached to the door and which activates the shredder had broken off. The shredder will not work without it and gives a message that the door is not closed, even when it is. For such an important function, they could have made this small plastic piece sturdier than it is.. Amazon replaced the shredder and the actual functioning of the machine is fine, but I am mindful of this thin plastic tab when I open and close the door. I also want to note that the shredder is heavy.

  I purchased this shredder despite some bad reviews but the unit has proven to work quite well.  To be realistic, one cannot expect a shredder priced under $100 to be industry grade and be able to run non-stop for over 30 minutes without over heating.  For a normal house hold this works fine.  Obviously the user should not load more than 8 normal thickness of paper at one time (or less if the paper is extra thick).  I shredded a big pile of old paperwork, with intermittent pauses to look at the statements, and the unit did not over heat.  Slightly off center feeds were not a problem.. And the cross cut provides higher security than the strip cuts, although not quite as good as the micro cut.  But again, good enough for a normal household.Will update if performance changes over time.

  Product was exactly as discribed. I was a little worried after reading reviews of it over heating or not working at all. I thought I'd try it for the price, and my worries were immediately put to rest. I cleaned out my file cabinet. I apparently tossed an envelope that had a dime in it. It made a horrendous noise, and I immediately turned it off. I put it in reverse and out popped a dime. The dime was a little ate up, but the shredder still works perfectly. It went on to shred these two bags, and another almost full bag still in the canister. It also shredded several credit cards and IDs like it was nothing. I did almost 3 full canisters (periodically pushing down the shredded material) in one sitting. It did get a little warm, which is to be expected. It was by no means hot or anything I was remotely worried about. I also turn it off when it's not in use. There is a customer service number on the machine. Will update if I encounter any issues, though I doubt I will.

  edit:  I ended up not returning cause it was so well price.  But it took me over an hour to deal with the jam and it def cannot take as many sheets at once as advertised.  As long as you just use a few sheets at a time it will be fine...Jammed up the first time i used it.  Tried that oil and it didn't work.  No other way to free up.  Sending back.  Got jammed above the cutting blades and there's no other way to free up.  I guess you can take the whole thing apart.  No thanks.  Not even close to the maximum capacity.  Returning and looking for a machine that can easily get unjammed...  Annoying.  Amazon basics not ready for prime time.....

  GOOD:  -- Notably quiet.  -- Paper shreds to a small size that is unlikely to be reassembled, especially after you mix the bag.  -- Opening seems too small for adult fingers (a plus for safety).  -- A shredder bag can easily fit over the canister.  -- Relatively fast.  -- Easy to operate.  --Doesn't seem to create and scatter visible dust like some micro-cut shredders do.  -- Seems to be well-made and should be durable.NOT-SO-GOOD:  -- Shredded paper seems to stick to the cogs at the exit, which makes it rather messy when emptying the bag unless you brush the paper hanging down from the cogs.  -- Gummed envelope material seems to stick to the cogs even more than regular paper.  This means shredding those dad-gum gummed address labels is probably not a good idea (we use scissors on those).  --The shredded paper is not compacted in the bin, so you'll have to push the paper down or empty the bin more often.  -- I know you're not supposed to do this, but access for repairing the machine is limited (we doubled the life of our previous shredder by disassembling and cleaning the rotors). -- The bin doesn't easily shut after being opened for emptying, and apparently Amazon does not sell replacement bins, so if yours jams while shutting it for goodness sake don't force it.SUMMARY:  It's a good value -- quiet, fairly inexpensive, small size of shredded paper without creating visible dust, capability for several sheets at once.

  I was planning on using this for shredding financial records, but quickly found out that if you feed standard, horizontal ""landscape"" reports into the shredder in a vertical ""portrait"" way, the pieces are so long that you can clearly read complete numbers, account descriptions and codes, names attached to specific accounts, etc.  Can't count on everyone using it the other way.  Just not acceptable for a ""cross-cut"" shredder.  Am now going to have to go through what was ""shredded"" and cut them up individually.

  Pretty thrilled with this shredder right now !  I was suspicious at first and considered sending it back because it had shreds in the bottom of the drawer already like someone had used it and sent it back. Instead, I opted to try it first.  I had a completely full 15 gallon garbage bag of financial documents  in the corner of my bedroom that I had been unable to shred with my old super slow shredder that would shut down after 2-3 minutes of use. So, I commenced shredding, and shred, and shred and shred, nonstop, until the entire bag was finished ! This shredder is definitely KING of shredders, IMO, for the price ! VERY happy !

  The strips into which the paper shreds are quite large -- large enough that you could actually read a whole twelve-point font on each shred.  It's adequate security for those of us who don't expect the FBI to analyze our trash content, but compared to the last cross-cut shredder I had at a similar tier (a Royal CX80 Cross Cut Shredder), this is disappointing.It really is a LIGHT DUTY machine.  It jams easily, and will stop without the overheat indicator lighting.  It might be unfair to remove a star because the machine, which pretty much advertises itself as light duty, proves that it actually is.  But I've had two other ostensibly light-duty shredders which were robust than this one.It otherwise is a decent shredder.  The design, where the mechanical unit just sits on top of the bucket, is good:  You can line the bucket with a plastic bag, and if the bucket fills and starts pushing the shredder up, you can still empty the unit without getting shredded paper all over the place, as might happen with a unit that uses a drawer or tilt-bin.  The unit is quiet.  The motor runs a full second or so after it finishes with the last page, so if you feed more paper in, the motor cycles less than if it were to shut instantly.  This also allows the paper to get all the way through the shredder even if it were fed at an angle.  I've shred some solid cardstock without problem, and it seems to be true to its eight-sheet capacity of normal weight paper, for the most part, with some qualification.  I do shred in volume -- more than is appropriate for these small machines -- so I might demand more than it's designed for.

  SAYS it's made for home office,  I guess because if it was a commercial office it would cost to much labor to operate it.  SORRY BUT apparently Amazon basics means CHEAP JUNK.  The shredder  has a deep intake slot probably for safety. If it struggles, it reverses and jams the intake slot WHICH IS almost impossible to clear.  It says 12  sheets, I say caution at 10.  Not sure this one will survive the home office.  OK, my fault for ordering on line from Amazon.  This is the first thing I purchased that was branded Amazon, yes made in China... GRRRR  their return policy sucks or I would trade it for better.  If I return it for exchange I get the same junk again.  The freight for return for credit would eat up the price, its heavy.  DO NOT BUY.

  I order a lot from Amazon for convenience but it's a gamble.  If you receive something and it doesn't work, going to UPS, boxing and returning is a pain in the ass.  This item took in one envelope, maybe 4 pages in thickness and powered down and would start back up.

  There isn’t much that can go wrong with these things unless you abuse them by stuffing paper or multiple charge cards into it. We used it conservatively, only shredding envelopes or bill statements, one at the time. We emptied it as needed. One day it simply stopped working. We tried to unclog the roller device inside but it could not be repaired for any less than it is worth. Three months later, we have to replace it. If you’re looking at this model, I strongly recommend you look further unless you don’t mind it’s ridiculously short shelf life.

  I just got it earlier this week, but I had gathered bags and bags of old paperwork that needs to be shredded and there is no public drop-off point for me in these times.  I went for a 24 page shredder as a compromise between quality and price.  This unit more than meets my needs and although in one sitting I will not be able to shred everything, this will work just fine if you have lots to shred.On the page limit, I only got the overload once and I was amazed because the shredder attempted to auto-correct itself by throwing it in reverse and then forward into the jam was cleared.  And it did clear the jam itself without any manual intervention.  I can't say that I counted the number of pages I fed it at a time, but I was feeding it fistfuls of paper and like I say just one jam.Also, I shredded receipts, prescription sheets and all kinds of other irregular paper without problems.  I inserted either vertically or horizontally and it worked either way.The bin size is just fine for me.  I felt I got a good amount of shredding in before I had to empty it.The one wish-list item that I would want which does not affect the rating is that there is no oil-sheet to lubricate the shredder and I hear these can be expensive.  So make sure you find other ways, but I am not there yet.

  Got this a while ago for my husbands office and after only 5 uses, it has died. He only ever puts one paper at a time in it so it wasn't overworked. We are only in our 20's so it's not like we have a lot of stuff to shred besides important bills or the occasional paper with our personal info on them. I wish I would have just paid a little more for a better sredder because it's too late to return this. It's going in the garbage now. They don't build things like they used to smh

  This shredder was purchased to replace a Fellowes strip shredder that lasted for fifteen years.  I chose this cross cut Amazon Basics over the Amazon Basics micro cut.  Both Shredders were the same price.  This cross cut model may make less of a mess when emptying the collection basket.I did shred fifteen 20 pound pages as the shredder is rated without a problem, but I will go no higher than nine or ten pages just to play it safe in hopes the shredder will have a long life. I don’t see a security issue with this cross shredder for my needs.  I don’t picture an international spy ring digging thru my garbage.  See attached photo of a shred example.  I examined the shredded paper closely and could not find any readable information.  If you are concerned are about account numbers, SSNs, etc. just feed the paper where the printed text is parallel/horizontal to the feed slot whether it’s a micro or cross cut.  This shredder did a great job shredding a DVD with personal information on it.  The DVD is definitely completely destroyed.Do oil the cutting blades as recommended.  All shredders need maintenance.  Overall I would recommend this shredder.PROS• Secure shred• Safety features• Auto Feed• Continuous reverse and forward if needed• The basket has rollers on the rear that fit into tracks keeping the basket straight and lined up as required• Large window to check if the basket is getting full.  See attached photo• Shreds a DVD/CD• The noise level is no more or less that any other consumer/small office shredderCONS• The power cord is five feet in length.  A standard six footer would be nice.• The printed description of the status lights (power on, errors) and switch (ON/OFF, FWD, REC, AUTO) is very small for the average senior or person with similar vision capabilities

  It stopped working out of the blue. Never used more than one page at a time. Took really good care of it. Tried different outlets, it's stopped working. Doesn't even reverse. Poor quality :(

  I bought this shredder last week after looking at the 4.7 star rating and the great price of $99.99. So far has performed as rated. Glad I didn't spend the $189 for the comparable Fellowes shredder. Good job Amazon. I give it 5 stars.

  I bought this as a replacement for my home shredder but it was no better than the one it replaced.  If you have serious shredding to do, then this is not a good model.  If you are using it every day, perhaps, it would be ok.  But if you're like me, and only shred from time to time, it simply is not powerful enough to handle mass shredding days.

  I want to preface this review by saying that I purchased the AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder with Pullout Basket, and that thing is absolutely wonderful. I am spoiled with that thing by comparison, but I needed a small shredder for a second location where I don't need to shred a bunch of documents. That led to this purchase.This is a smaller shredder with a smaller capacity waste bucket that the shredder mounts on top of. you can use a plastic bag inside to catch all the waste. It is a standard crosscut that cuts thin short strips, but not as fine as the micro-cut. It was able to cut 6 pages of 20lb paper without any problem, but it slows a little to do so- no big deal. It seems like it has good power and might be able to do more in a single pass, but I don't want to chance this- that is what the bigger shredder is for.My impression is that this small shredder will fit the intended purpose for light duty use- a couple of papers here and there. It is priced at a steal of a deal at $30, especially if you have amazon prime and the thing ships to you in 2 days or less- shipping along on a similar package would cost about $12 bucks by UPS Ground...not Second Day Air. If you have a bunch of shredding to do, consider the bigger shredder- AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder with Pullout Basket. That thing is like a paper grinder- works well and makes a neater generated paper waste that pours out of the can.

  Have had this for seven months. Jams from time to time and can be unjammed by running back and forth in reverse and forward. However, for some reason I thought it was an 8 page shredder and never loaded more than 6 sheets at a time. After home use for seven months the plastic handle came off. It is held in place by 4 small screws that are screwed in holes in the plastic. It is what is used to take off the cover which holds all the weight of the motor and blades. If you have to take the cover apart to expose the innards there are about 6 screws to try to find including one that is hidden by a warning tag and 3 or 4 that are concealed in recessed holes. Worst of all is that Amazon Basics does not stock replacement for the plastic handle. Buy a different brand since repair parts are lacking from Amazon Basics. For the sake of some inappropriate cheap plastic used where a more heavy duty handle and better attachment method, Amazon Basics destroyed what could have been a fair product.

  Last it lasted 6 years! And this one cost $4 less!A few pointers...1. Don't try to shove envelopes full of paper into this thing.- It's not a high-end device, but it will do the job.-Go ahead and open each envelope an feed the pages one or two at a time (seriously, you can take a few seconds to do this). :-) it will keep the motor alive slot longer.2. The weight of the motor and cutting blades makes it a little top heavy, so find a stable place to put it (like between a chair and a cabinet) to keep it from spilling over.3. Feed your shredder an 'oil sandwich' once a month: take two pieces of paper, zig-zag a pattern of some light cooking oil (not motor or olive oil, please) on one of the pages, then slap the other page on top of it; like pieces of bread around a jelly sandwich... then feed it to your shredder.- Putting the oil between sheets of paper contains the oil and limits the amount smeared on the mouth of the shredder.- This will lube the blades to make future shreds much easier.- Read the manual that accompanies the shredder for more info on oiling requirements.4. Recycle your shredded paper.  I recycle my old clear plastic dry cleaning bags to gather the shreds and put out with all the plastic stuff. Our local recycling plant staff asks us to put shredded paper in clear bags so they can see what is inside before they open it up.Happy shredding!!!

  I give this shredder three and a half stars.  I think it's solid overall and should last a long time.  The build quality seems good, and I don't notice any weakness in this area.  The noise level is ""ok.""  It's definitely quieter than the 10-year old Fellowes shredder it replaced, but I don't find the new sound level to be anything groundbreaking.  I haven't had the troubles of closing the bin like others have.  I keep a trash bag in it, and every once in awhile it won't close all the way.  I just give it a tap or adjust the bag, and it's fine.  The one annoyance I have that bothers me is the size or angle of the opening for the paper to shred.  I find the opening to be too narrow for my liking, and if I have any more than approximately five papers, I find it difficult to insert them.  The opening itself is at a slight angle, as well, so I have to try to angle the papers in, or I have to make sure each paper in the stack is straightened really well.  Even a single receipt can be slightly frustrating at times.  With my Fellowes, the opening was easily accessible, straight up and down at the top.  I found that design to be easier and more user friendly.  The other half star I took off was because there are deals on other shredders that are micro-cut where this one isn't.  This does shred small, so it's not a complete deal breaker.  The bottom line I ask myself is:  Would I buy it again?  And in this case, no, I don't think I would.  It does work well, and it will get the job done, so if it's at a great price compared to others and you don't use it that much, sure go for it.  But the next time I personally shop for one, I will look for one that is easier to feed, that's micro cut, and one that is even quieter if possible.  Best of luck.

  About a week ago my shredder would automatically turn on and stay on until I switched it off. I contacted Amazon Service and they said that because I had shredded address labels, that may have affected the sensor, which was now causing the shredder to automatically turn on. They also informed me that because I had shredded labels, I had automatically voided my warranty. Their only suggestion? Try cleaning the slot where you insert paper with alcohol. If that doesn't work then, you'll have to just manually turn it on/off when you want to use it. That's it. Prior to this shredder I owned a FELLOWS shredder which lasted 10+ years. Silly me for switching brands and assuming that Amazon would make a shredder that would  shred labels. The fact is I don't really know  if it's because of the labels I shredded or a defective sensor and thanks to Amazon, I'll never know. AND... I'll never buy another Amazon Basics item  ever again. Amazon... you just lost a loyal Amazon Prime customer. Shame on you!

  ... and those are about the only positive things I can say for it.The list shortcomings of this shredder are taller than the short squat can it comes with.  To start, I ran about 12 sheets of paper through it one at a time and the can was already about 1/2 full.  It wouldn't take a lot more pages before I'd have to empty it.  And then, there's the narrow, tiny, little feed slot.  Read the specification carefully.  It is only 0.2"" wider than a standard sheet of paper.  Plus, the feed isn't vertical.  You have to come in at a 45-degree angle to get the paper into the feed to activate it.  I really don't know how you could fit 12 sheets of paper in there at a time unless they were very neatly stacked and compressed together.  (I didn't try it, as I was leary of it jamming up.)It works as described, but not all that great.  I guess AmazonBasics is finally at the point where they've put the ""basic"" into the product instead of quality or usability.

  I do not recommend purchasing this shredder. I just purchased the shredder less than three weeks ago and after shredding less than 30 pieces of paper it has completely shut down and is non-functional. I was very excited to use the shredder for at least six months to year. The worst part is that I've attempted to return the shredder to Amazon for a replacement considering this may just be a lemon shredder. Amazon is stating that is outside the window for return which is shocking considering it is less than 2 to 3 weeks since I received it. Amazon usually is very good about returning or replacing dysfunctional faulty products. In this case scenario I have lost $40 for a useless product that I can't even return despite having had it for just less than three weeks. I usually expect way more than this from from an ""Amazon basic product"" which came with extremely high reviews from Amazon.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHREDDER.

  It does work but I am very disappointed with 2 things.1) It is very slow detecting paper that you insert !2) The shredder stops and tells you to empty it even when it is not completly full !Conclusion: Bad Chinese engineering on this shreeder !

  This shredder broke down within 8 months of purchase and under infrequent (once per week) use.  The shredder suddenly stopped ingesting the paper no matter the sheet count (one or two sheets, etc.). We never abused this shredder nor feed more than 4 sheets at a time; it should last longer than 8 months under light use!I tried to fix it by taking the engine components, cleaning them, etc. to no avail. I just wasted an hour of my time doing that.While it was operational it worked as expected; but I cannot recommend it due to its poor longevity.

  Have had no issues, shreds fine. As one noted, some things shred where you can read some words....I doubt most are going to go to that much trouble to dig through your garbage to piece it all together [unless you're in some trouble with the law, and in that case-I suggest you burn your documents :P]. Most of it was broken up and made no sense, and being mixed with tons of other broken up/made no sense paper [not to mention, many of them where the words weren't readable]...I'm thinking a criminal wanting to steal your identity is going to want an easier target. For me personally, I'm satisfied.I have also shredded up to 6 sheets with no problems, as well as cards. I like that it is compact, but solid and the blades are thick. The top is heavier than I thought it would be, and the waste basket very light. Controls simple and easy.  Will revise if for any reason product doesn't hold up, has malfunctions or breaks, in reasonable time span of course [nothing lives forever].

  I originally ordered this product and received it January 26, 2018. I used it maybe five times, each time shredding no more than 2 pages at a time (even though it claims to be an 8-sheet shredder) over an extended period of time. The unit stopped working without cause on Feb. 13, 2018.I received a free replacement on Feb. 17, 2018, as it was within the 30 day warranty period. However, the replacement item was barely used between March and April and on April 27, 2018, it stopped working (same as the original unit).Given both the original unit and the replacement performed poorly and came no where near meeting my expectations, I do not recommend this product. If you're going to spend over $30 on a shredder, get something reliable that you won't have to replace every month!

  Shredder would not power on right out of the box and had to return.  Appears not to have been tested prior to shipping as there was no evidence of paper shreds or dust in the collection bin.  This is a very large heavy shredder and it was difficult to take to my local UPS store to ship back.  Customer service was great however and I received my refund immediately.  Ended up buying a new shredder locally.

  When something says it will shred credit cards, I expect it to do as it claims.  It didn't.  Now it won't work.  I was going to return it, but the shipping alone is more expensive than what I paid for the shredder.  No thank you.  As far as the rating,  the shredder itself is sturdy, but I WILL NOT SHRED CREDIT CARDS.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  In this day and time, that is one of the most important things to shred.

   This is a great machine at an even better price! It will only shred 6 pages at a time, so if you have a business where you need to shred a good amount each day-you might consider getting one of the 12-page shredders. I just went through a stack of documents about 2 inches thick and had to mash the shreds down. When I mashed them down it was only half full in the container. It comes with a small container. As you can see from the pictures, the entire shredder is about the same size as my computer tower. It fits under my desk very well. One of the things I really like about this is that I do not have to buy expensive oil for the machine. The instructions say I can just use vegetable oil once a month! I also like that it came with a flyer saying that the product had already been tested and might have some paper scraps left in it. I like that each unit is tested- lowers your chances of getting a lemon and having to go through the hassle to exchange it! I am impressed with the product and would gladly buy another if needed.

  I have now been through 3 of these shredders. Each one failed for the same reason: the reverse function was inoperative, both auto and manual. This third machine basically failed right out of the box! I was shredding only 12 sheets at a time. After 15 minutes the ""overload"" light came on, but the machine failed to auto-reverse. The manual reverse also failed to work, so there it was, with 12 sheets half in the slot and half still sticking out. Without the reverse function it is impossible to remove the unshredded sheets as they are firmly ""locked"" in the shredding teeth.This unit is rated for 24 sheets of 20 lb paper at a time, 40 minutes run time before 50 minutes ""rest.""  It could not handly even 12 sheets at a time for 15 minutes.I'm returning this for credit, as I have no faith that a 4th unit will work any better. As this is an ""Amazon Basics"" item, Amazon should have direct access to the manufacturers and should inform them that they can no longer carry this product.Kudos to Amazon's generous return policy!

  If I could give this six stars I would. What a great trouble free hard worker. I went though a lot of old documents, three large trash bags full. The beast never complained nor shut off! (There were breaks for my sorting.) It shredded plastic cards easily and the see through window is helpful. The wheels are nice as you can just role it to your work space. If this product is indicative of Amazon Basics, I will look there first in the future. Shipping was fast and the shredder came double boxed. Shipping trucks ""vary""  so double boxed  was a good thing as well! I notice some had a problem with the door. You don't want it to run with the door open clearly but, I had no problem with the door staying shut.

  I couldn’t wait to receive my new shredder, but was disappointed when I unboxed it. The two boxes it arrived in (printer box inside Amazon box) were completely undamaged, no marks or dents, but as soon as I pulled out the drawer I noticed it was broken. The top was broken and hanging down, which made it a little difficult to pull out the drawer, and there were actually shredded pieces of paper inside. This tells me that they tried to sell me a used product. I’m very unhappy. The part that really stinks is that if I order another one I will have to wait 1 to 2 months for it to arrive. Not cool, especially since I only had to wait about a week for this one. I’m thinking I may go with another brand just to bypass the long shipping time. If you’re going to try to pass used products as new, at least have someone qualified enough to check them to make sure it’s at least empty of garbage. I gave it 2 stars only because it seemed okay otherwise. Nice and sturdy, wheels on bottom to easily move it around, and easy to pick up without having the top come off like other shredders.

  Granted I've had this shredder for over 5 years and it's worked well with very limited use but, in my opinion, I believe it nearly caused my house to burn down! I just came home from being at work all day and when I walked in the house I immediately heard a very loud ""machine"" noise I did not recognize. Starting to panic as it got louder as I got closer to the source, I found this shredder in our home office running all by itself for no reason. There was nothing jammed in the feed slot that could have caused it to activate automatically. It had apparently been running for hours as it was nearly hot enough to melt the plastic the case was made of and smelled of a strong electrical burning smell. It sounded terrible, like the motor was about to seize up. I have used Amazon Basics products before and never had a problem, but I seriously doubt I will ever buy another electrical product by Amazon Basics. This thing was very dangerous.

  It does the job and does it fast! We own a notary business and print packets up to 200 pages each multiple times a day. When something goes awry with printing or an appointment get cancelled post printing, we have a lot of shredding to do to protect our client’s personal information. This shredder is fast, and can handle shredding two sets of 200 page packets without overheating or getting jammed when shredding up to 20 pages at a time. I have to empty the bin more often than I would like to, but so far, that’s my only complaint. Hands down one of my favorite, most therapeutic pieces of home office equipment

  Very happy with my purchase. Great addition for our household and my small biz shredding needs.Pros: It makes quick work of shredding. It's quieter than I anticipated (MUCH quieter than my last one/diff brand). So far, even with shredding tons of stuff, it hasn't hit an overheat phase (giving it a break every couple of minutes). Easily shreds old credit cards. I even threw in a few pieces of junk mail, envelope and all. Great little machine has pulverized everything I've put in it so far. I trust Amazon to stand behind their branded products.Cons: Says it can shred up to 12 pages at once; really slows down when shredding just 7 so I won't tempt anything more at one time. Would prefer a larger bin; knew what I was getting but I'm emptying the bin far more than I anticipated. May be because it cross cuts vs. regular shredder I am used to.Overall - very happy with the product and the price.

  Had a Fellowes shredder that only took two pages per insertion but it lasted 20+ years in my home office. Finally died. Decided on this one because my needs are now less, it had decent features and the price was right. Sorry about the choice.First day in the house I tried a 9 page insertion even though it's supposedly capable of 12. I'm always skeptical of that claim. It took 9 but groaned. So I dropped to 6. Took 6 one time. The next time it jammed completely. Would not reverse to regurgitate the jammed paper and would not continue the shred. Total stop. I then spent 30 minutes pulling jammed paper bits out with a long-nosed tweezer from the top and bottom. Turned it off for 30 minutes. Turned it on. Nothing. That's it for me. If an item conks out in the first minutes of use I'm not going to keep trying. Sent it back. Will probably buy another Fellowes for more money.

  It is a paper shredder.... not much more to say than that except do not go even one page over the recommended limit. This will clog up and shut down. I shredded probably 5 batches of 5 sheets each and it overheated. I shredded one page over the limit, and it clogged up and shut down. Update: After using this for a second time, it stopped working.

  AmazonBasics are generally good quality items....this is no exception.  The 8-sheet shredder is powerful and well made and perfectly complements a small or home office environment. Controls are simple and easy to use. I replaced my $200 Fellowes shredder with the $35 AmazonBasics shredder and I wasn't disappointed. The collection bin is half the size of my old shredder but I knew it's capacity before I bought it.  This just means that I will have to empty the shredder more than I did before. This is one reason why it probably wouldn't work well in a large office environment. I haven't tried more than 8 sheets of standard copy paper but why risk a jam.  I generally limit my shreds to 4 / 5 pieces of paper at a time and this shredder eats them up.

  I hesitated paying up for this shedder but after using it I'm convinced it was money well spent.  First off, the little things: It will run in auto mode - shove a paper in the slot and it sheds it. Or constant mode - turn it on and let it rip.  When shedding large projects this makes a huge difference and it is easier on the motor.  Then there is the window in the bin.  Lets you know exactly how full it is.  The bin seems small, but that's because this thing is fast.  I had a pile if documents that look taller than two reams of paper.  I had to empty the bin 5 times but I was done in less than 20 minutes.  Finally, it is very quiet.  Low motor noise so all you get to hear is the satisfying crunch of paper going through the knives.  I recommend this shredder highly.

  I had several file cabinets worth of shredding to accomplish over a weekend.  I did not want to spend $$$ on a shredder, so I opted for this model.  I was concerned that it would overheat, but it worked like a champ!  I shredded about 10-12 bins worth in one day and it NEVER overheated!  It did jam a few times when I pushed the 12-sheet limit, but I was able to get that resolved.  I do wish the bin was larger, but overall, I am very happy with this shredder and I think it is excellent for the ~$50 price point.

  Fire Danger.  I have found this shredder running and very hot when I have not been in the room  It has started by itself several times.  It gets very very hot when running for an extended period of time and I believe it could catch on fire.  I have unplugged it and use it only as a wast basket now.  This product should not be sold until they figure out what causes it to start running for no reason.  No there was no paper scraps in the blades and I had not used it for days when it started to run by itself.  DANGER.

  I bought this after considering a much more expensive brand. It's a powerful little machine that fully supports my mission to switch my home office to paperless records and it fits under my desk!. This would have been a 5 star review except for the poor design of the bin door. It has a very small plastic gadget that must be in place for the door to properly shut. It took me a while to figure this out as this piece fell into the bin when I closed the door the first time. This caused a red light on the shredder and rendered it inoperable. When I finally realized the problem and found the gadget, I used Superglue to permanently secure it.

  This works great! I don't typically test it with the full 8-sheet capacity, but I regularly put mail through that hasn't been opened yet, such as credit card offers, and it handles them just fine. I finally got rid of the huge stack of mail that had been building up on my counter because I didn't want to throw it away but I had lent my old shredder to a friend and never got it back. So, after some research I finally bit the bullet and bought a new one. I do like the cross-cut as my old one just did the strips. I feel this one is more secure, but it's not like I'm shredding secret government documents or million-dollar bank statements. Still, it would take some serious effort to try to put these bits back together.I did try shredding a credit card and although it slowed a bit, it handled it. You just have to do those one at a time. I also put through stacks of paper and even if some of them got fed in at a bit of an angle, it didn't jam and everything went through fine. Again, it slows a bit, but that's fine as long as it doesn't jam.The first day I got it, I used it for about a half hour and it didn't overheat or shut off. I pretty much filled up it on the first round and it was a trooper. I know you can put bags in it but since I just use it for paper, I simply empty it into my other recycle bag when it's full and ready to go out. That's better anyway since the bags are recyclable and I'm trying to be better about that.This could also be used to make packing paper as the shredded bits would pack nicely around breakable items. Or, you could shred some pretty colored paper to make your own stuffing for presents. Or confetti. The possibilities are endless and I'm sure someone has made a Pinterest board about it.All in all, I'm pretty happy with this and would recommend it. I've had good luck with the Amazon brand.

  TL;DR: Spend a few more dollars for something more reliable.Bought Dec 2015 and only used roughly twice per month shredding a small amount of paper each time (receipts, letters with personal information, etc.), but started developing issues within a year where the motor would not stop. Every time time we'd ""fix"" it by using a cotton swap to clean around the sensor area, usually several rounds of cleaning at 5-15 mins total. We've lubricated the machine regularly with shredder oil, and always cleaned it on a regularly basis.After suffering the Stockholm Syndrome for over a year, I finally realized that I could've spent a bit more to buy a better shredder instead of putting up with this every few weeks. A shredder that's barely used should not develop problems this quickly, no matter how inexpensive it is.

  The shredder does exactly what it says it will do and if you jam it, it's probably your own fault. This is great for destroying mail or personal information in moderation. This product would not work for politicians attempting to hide unscrupulous campaign finance histories.

  The only issue here is the sensor for the hopper keeps saying it is full. You have to jiggle it around to get the sensor to realize that the hopper is empty. I attempted to get warranty service. They responded that I had to correct my email address since it was purchased on a different email account. I did do this and responded to them that it was under my account. To date, now 3 weeks since I responded to them, I have heard no word. Good price. HORRIBLE customer service. The thing is worthless because the sensor thinks it is full all the time so I cannot use it. I haven't shredded anything for over 2 months now.They finally got back to me and refunded the money that I spent on this. I have purchased another brand.

  Within the first couple of minutes of normal use, the machine started throwing a horrendous knocking noise as it shredded. I looked at the underside of the shredder head and saw a huge crack in the plastic, causing it to be deformed and hit the shredder blades. Either the machine completely split apart during normal use (that's bad) or it shipped with a large crack that opened up once the blades started moving (also bad).I'm returning it for a replacement, because I need a shredder, but I'd avoid this machine and the ""Amazon"" brand in the future if I were a smarter shopper.

  I tested the shredder when it came. Then I left it off. Now, when I turn it on, the green light is on, but the shredder does not sense the paper that's placed in. No motion at all. Of course, I don't have the original box it came in. Can't return it.

  I owned this item for close to a year. One day it started continuously shredding, as if something was tripping the automatic sensor. After unplugging and cleaning it, I plugged it back in and it kept continuously trying to shred, as if there was something tripping the sensor. i then put it in reverse and put it into automatic mode and it made an ear-splitting pop and started smoking. I unplugged it and let it cool down.If this had happened while I was away, it could have set the shredded paper inside on fire and then caused my entire house to burn down. I strongly recommend Amazon pull this product immediately and issues a recall to every single one it has sold.

  Whether you’re a college student or a professional that needs something for the office, this shredder doesn’t disappoint. I really like the cross-cut feature because it utilizes more bin space. This means that it’ll be able to hold more shreds of paper. It’s powerful and reliable and I haven’t had any problems with it since. I use it quite often and have only had to empty it once (out of the 4 months I’ve had it for). Its compact size makes it perfect for storing in tight spaces. Amazon claims that it’ll keep shredding for around 3 minutes before overheating with the rest time estimated at 30 minutes. Sounds like a long time, but then again you can’t expect grade A performance on a budget shredder. I personally never ran into any overheating issues, but if you’re someone that does a lot of routine shredding and in large batches, then I’d suggest looking at a higher end model. Overall, it’s a quality product and definitely worth the investment given the price point and features.

  I bought this to replace one from a big box office supply store that failed after about 5 years.  This one is essentially exactly the same as my other one - same cross-cut, same footprint, same features, about the same price.  It does have one better design feature, the fact that the little handhold in the front, the hand-sized opening in the trashcan part allows you to easily see when it is filling up.  The ONLY reason I took one star off is because of what I'm assuming is a safety feature, which I just find annoying:  In my previous model, you could walk up to the shredder and just feed the paper right in, nothing special, in it went.  On this one, there is not a direct, vertical feed option - the feed area has a ""cover"" of sorts built into it that requires you to feed the paper in practically horizontal to the unit.  I'm absolutely certain this is on purpose, to prevent small fingers and such from getting dragged in.  But I find it a bit annoying.

  I had a hand-me-down paper shredder from my dad that was probably 20 years old, and the auto function, well, didn't function.I tend to accumulate a stack of mail and documents that need shredding then do it all in one go. With the old one, I had to let it run the entire time, so as far as I'm concerned, this thing is awesome.Mainly, the auto function functions. So on the occasions that I do just have one paper to get rid of, I can just process it without having to switch it on. It can handle a decent amount of papers too. I don't make a habit of this but I've just thrown entire envelopes into this thing and, you can hear it working but it chows through them without slowing down. It can also eat credit cards or similar plastics without an issue. It has a designated slot for cards but I'm not sure that it matters all that much.I like that it has a cross-cut function, just to make it extra difficult for dedicated trash-spies to tape together a discarded credit card offer or bank statement.It also has a reverse function, just in case you get halfway through a document and realize you still need the top half.An added benefit is the safety triggers, where if you pull the unit out of the container, it will cease to function until it is back in its place. Or at least the triggers are pressed.It's Amazon Basics and it is better than basic for me, so I'm thoroughly pleased with it, and I've had it for several months at this point. Not bad at $35 either.

  My husband and I finally hit the point of ""we can shred anything older than ______"". So we went through all our paperwork, Did some Marie Kondo on reorganizing the stuff we needed to keep. And ended up with 4 paper boxes that needed to be shredded. Realizing we would need a shredder long term going forwarded, we landed on this due to the great reviews and longevity others had mentioned.  I got this shredder on Tuesday and as of tonight (2 days later), this shredder has helped me finish 4 paper boxes into 4 garbage bags FULL.  We're talking about 5,000 pages of statements, bills, records, files, and stubs.  This thing is noisy, but it stops if it is tipped or not inserted to the can accurately, has a warning light if it gets too hot (only happened once in all my hours of shredding), can handle staples like a champ, and no papers got stuck.  Only downside - the can is small - but that wont be an issue for our daily/weekly shredding. It's only a big deal for this big project. VERY HAPPY!!!!

  I just got the shredder, and have been using it almost all day. So far it hasn’t overheated, there isn’t a huge mess, and it shreds perfectly. I’ve had shutters before that didn’t cut the paper or items small enough, and I worried about someone digging through my trash and finding important information. I’m someone that works in the field that everything that I signed or has to do with a client needs to be shredded, as well as bills Social Security number, and any bank statements or items that have my information get shredded. I’ve had my bank Information taken before, and with the shredder I’m confident that it won’t happen again. Also it’s not extremely loud, which helps if you’re a pet owner

  I've been looking for a shredder for a while now since, while fun, burning documents isn't the most practical thing in the world. Luckily, I got this on sale.I was a little apprehensive after seeing reviews of it not working properly, but I wanted to give it a shot. So far, it's been working wonderfully. Even though it's listed as 8 sheets, I don't do more than 4-5 to play safe. It did start to show signs of overheating (I was getting rid of a LOT like old bank statements and theatre scripts i have no use for), so I let it cool down like the instructions stated.The main cons is that it did have chunks stuck after big passes, but I think that was because I was a little careless. And it's easy to clear out. It's also on the small side so you're going to empty it pretty frequently. But that's not a big issue.Overall, I recommend it.Update: A few months later and she's still working marvelously. One recommendation- don't insert big chunky spam mail as it doesn't destroy it entirely.

  Cross-cut is key and Amazon has made this product well, especially for a reasonable price. I consider this AmazonEssential not AmazonBasic. Every household should keep one of these for shredding bills and other sensitive information - these days you need to protest yourself against identity thieves that will go through trash.I've been using this for long enough to feel like it's DEFINITELY worth the money.ProsChews through day to day mail and sensitive information or expired cardsEasy to empty and re-lubricateConsThis is for light home use, it is not intended for bulk jobs in one long session (it's labeled appropriately, and lives up to description)That society necessitates having a shredder at all

  I had a shredder for several years that worked great; it was made by Fellowe's. When Amazon offered me a new model under the Amazon Vine Program, I jumped at it, since my old one was getting on and was several years old.  I figured it couldn't last too much longer.  I had the new one about three months, until the time came to empty the basket for the first time. After I did, it jammed and would not work.  So I adjusted my Vine Review accordingly and ordered this one.  It arrived today.I took it out of the box and read the User Manual thoroughly.  Then I plugged it in and switched it on.  I had several pieces of paper to shred, since I had been without a shredder for almost a week.I fed in the first sheet of paper.  I could hear it shred, but the paper did not advance into the shredder.  I pulled the paper out and noted that the edge of the paper - barely one quarter inch - had been shredded.  I turned the paper around and tried feeding it from the other end, with the same results.So, I pulled out another sheet of paper that needed to be shredded and tried that.  Same thing - the shredder shredded the edge of the paper, but the paper would not advance further into the machine.  I put the shredder back in the box it came in and notified Amazon that I want a refund.When I had opened the box to unpack the latest machine, there was a note from Amazon that said that ""each shredder is tested before it is shipped, so you may notice some paper scraps in the baske""t.  Well, if they'd tested the machine I got, they never would have shipped it.  Because it doesn't work.I wonder if Amazon gets tired of paying the postage on returns for defective products, the same way I get tired of packing them up and shipping them back?  Because this is - believe it or not - the third item I have had to return to Amazon this week.Please fellas - stop sending out defective merchandise!

  I finally got my mother to start shredding confidential documents. She like to sit at the dining room table to open mail and real documents. This is low enough that she can put it next to the wall and the table and is mostly concealed. It has enough information on the panel to remind her about how to shred and reverse. It will handle 12 sheets just fine and its easy for her

  It's really great to not have to open every single credit card offer letter. Just shred the whole thing. But if you recycle paper, you might be used to using paper bags to empty the bin into so you can just recycle everything all at once. The bin on this one is too big for a paper grocery bag so you always end up with a mess on the floor that you have to clean up afterwards. Otherwise, the unit performs as advertised.

  It was time to replace my current shredder of many years, after the motor burned out and just would not restart.  I was on the fence, after my last shredder was a popular brand that gave me excellent service aside from the expected jams, what to buy.  Researched many finding them to be rather expensive and did not want to spend a lot, since I only use when its time to get rid of the stack of bills etc. piling up.  Then I came across the AmazonBasics 6-Sheet Cross-Cut paper shredder at a really great price and thousands of reviews.  I made a decision to give it a try arriving today and immediately putting it to the test.  This model is almost identical in use to my old one and very easy to operate.  Made sure to read the book first and having a lot of paperwork started out at 30-minute intervals, the length of time for the basket to fill up.  It worked great with very little noise, however, the only problem, nothing major, I ran into is where exactly do I place the paper to line up.  So, after a few tries figured out centering the paper underneath the picture of a credit card just above center was helpful.  The way the top of the shredder is made I find it a little hard to see where exactly to insert the paper since it is hidden due to the way the top/shredder is designed.  So, again had to play around using the little credit card as my guide and slightly curled the paper so the shredder could grab it.  Note, where and how to line up the paper is somewhat misleading and realized the paper does not slide in flat like some, it needs to  be centered and curled slightly down.  Voila! it worked.  For the price well worth the purchase hoping it lasts as long as my old one.  Basket nice size but does fill up quickly depending on how much you need to shred but a great buy.  When not in use, unplug and leave in corner by outlet ready to go next time.  Would have given five stars but removed one star because of slight problem positioning paper without a guide.Follow-Up  12/2/2018 - So far I am very pleased with Amazon's shredder performing without any problems or hassles.  Works great, automatically turns off when gets overheated and once cooled down restarts with no trouble.  Still works great and easy to empty.  Recommend.

  Seems like you have to chose the reviews based on the author’s ability to understand the product. Received this shredder, read instructions—-such as—don’t let the bin fill up or unit will jam —or—-lubricate monthly using shredder oil, oil with unit operating in reverse—-or—-if unit does not shut off, clean paper sensing eye with Q-tip.Or here is a good one——overload red indicator ‘on’ means let unit cool down for at least 30 min. Yes it overheated!Point is, this unit runs great, easy to use and is priced right from my experience. It’s not idiot proof and can handle 12 pages max but not stack after stack. It’s a machine, read instructions, maintain it, it does well. For $60 it’s a great home/office shredder.

  Shame on me for not reading the description better.  I bought an Amazon Basics 12 sheet crosscut shredder a couple years ago and love it.  We needed a couple more shredders, so I thought I'd buy these.I was surprised that the ones now offered were significantly cheaper than the first one.  There's a reason.First one had a pullout bin.  This one sits on top.  When one needs to empty the bin, one needs to lift the shredding unit off the trash bin it sits on.  As it is lifted off, shreds drop off, not necessarily into the bin.After emptying the bin, be careful setting the shredding unit back on top.  It is pretty easy to pinch a finger.For whatever reason, the shreds do not disburse evenly through the bin.  If you glance down into the window, it may look like there is lots of room in the bin.  But if you lift the top off, there is a mountain of shreds in the middle directly under the shredding teeth.  So directly under the teeth the bin it is too full when it appears that there is plenty of room in the bin.So at the price point, it is probably ok.  But one usually gets what one pays for.  I would have rather spent more and gotten a better unit.  I've only used it once, so I cannot speak to its longevity.If you are going to shred only once in a while, I suppose it's okay.  But in a small office environment, where occasionally the is a lot to shred, look elsewhere.

  OK, really, what can you say about an inexpensive 8-sheet cross-cut paper shredder? This item is OK. It does what it is supposed to do and does it the way you would expect it to. It was purchased to replace a 20 year old inexpensive single-cut shredder from Staples which finally gave up the ghost and which could not cut through 8 sheets. There are, however, some things that I do not care for about this shredder. They are not of the level that would drive me to return or not purchase the shredder, they are just things that I wish were different. Number one, I do not like the way the feed slot functions. I realize that part of the design of the orientation of the slot is likely due to safety considerations, however, I find it often to be difficult to get the paper lined up and in perfectly straight to trip the feed switch. If it is the smallest bit off perfectly straight but still hits the switch, the paper will feed slightly crooked (not a major issue with my old shredder or with my office shredder) and will impinge on the sides of the slot, crinkling the paper and slowing the machine down. I've measured and the older machine (and some of the other small shredders I have looked at) had a slightly wider slot that made perfect alignment easier. The older machine (and others) also have a more direct, straight down from the top feed slot which, IMHO, makes it far easier when one is in a hurry, or when shredding a number of documents, to just feed the papers straight into the machine rather than on an angle from the front. Also, and I know that this is a safety feature and not Amazon's fault, but it is still, for me, a bother, and that is that the shredder head cannot be used by setting it into a cutout in the top of a larger waste receptacle and has to be set into its own [small] waste basket so that an internal safety switch is depressed. I'm trying to work out a safe override for this so I don't have to empty the thing every week, but just sayin'...So, if you are looking for an inexpensive, basic 8-sheet cross-cut paper shredder that capably shreds up to 8 sheets at a time (and credit cards which we all know we are shredding all the time, or perhaps should be), this should satisfy your basic needs. If not, take a look at a higher level Amazon shredder or, if you don't have a need for cross-cut shredding and can live with ribbon-cut, Amazon Basics has a straight top feed machine for less. They also sell several shredder heads that can be placed into larger waste receptacles which I did not notice before ordering this machine (that's what happens when you make a rushed purchase because the to-be-shredded papers start to add up and it isn't yet fireplace season, alas).

  I have only had this item a few days now but I am pleased. I did a couple of hours of shredding with no problems. It is easy to set up and empty. What I like best - it is actually quiet. I somehow doubt it would handle 15 pages at a time, however. I personally don't need it to do that so that's not an issue for me,  but for anyone who does, I am skeptical it would suit. I haven't tested its on CDs or credit cards either but feel confident it will do fine.

  This is the 2nd Amazon Basics shredder I've purchased.  Based on the great success with the original shredder I purchased and which handled 4 years of moderate-heavy shredding I've tried other Amazon Basics products like batteries; with great results as well.This shredder model just handled a 45 pound 4 day shredding party and handled it exceptionally well!  I expected catastrophic failure like overheating, jams...NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENED!  Absolutely incredible.  In fact, it never overheated.  No papers got stuck.  It was a miracle.At the 3 day mark the shredder was getting slow, starting to gurgle.  Strips of paper were getting wrapped up on the sides.  Thought, well, it just handled 40 pounds in 3 days, what did you expect?  But I used a sheet from the AmazonBasics SP12A Paper Shredder Sharpening & Lubricant Sheets - Pack of 12, thinking, we'll see if these do anything (like baking soda in the fridge) and today it was shredding smooth as silk once again.  Like it's brand new.So...A great incredibly durable shredder and great lubricant sheets.  Wholeheartedly recommend both products.

  In looking at the reviews, it is amazing the number in the last two months.  It appears the stay at home has pushed home cleanup and a lot of shredding is going on.  The benefit is that all these reviews have resulted in a broad spectrum review of this shredder for us to use in our selection.I have to join in with the group of buyers giving a 5 Star rating.  After shredding a lot of material (two garbage bags of shred) at a moderate rate of feed, staying around 4 to 6 sheets, the shredder has performed flawlessly.  The volume is what I would anticipate to be a years worth of material for use but this was done over a reasonable day.  You can hear the motor load up with the higher paper count but it completes the shred.  After shredding for awhile and noting the motor heating up, we'd take a break and get back to it.  We were getting about 1/2 hour of shred with a coffee break cooldown.  I believe what we did is probably beyond the expected use and it continues to perform very well.  I believe when we get to a normal use for us, this machine will be with us for quite awhile.  The shredder we purchased has been well worth the cost and I would highly recommend this unit for someone with a reasonable level of need.

  I'm giving it a ""one star,"" because I think those are the reviews that catch people's eye.  Thin thing shredded like a champ; but I had problems with switch.  It operated fine in the ""auto"" position.  I could feed in a hefty sheath of papers and it began shredding automatically.  If a jam occurred (and that was rare -- this thing is strong) it did not go into reversal automatically.  Moving the switch to the manual ""reverse"" position did not reverse the paper.  I never could get it to reverse.  Moving to the manual ""forward"" position would sometimes result in operation, which would generally restart the shredding.  The bin holds a reasonable amount of shredded output, but it filled up quickly when feeding paper 20+ sheets at a time.  It worked so well, I was tempted to keep it, despite the issues with the switch, but I finally told myself, ""look, it's not working right, send it back,"" so I did.  Amazon, as usual, was very good about accepting the return.  I still might reorder another one, as continuing to search for a replacement, it is obvious that nothing available under $1000 even begins to compare.

  First, the shredder is measurably inferior to other similar (and more expensive) cross-cut shredders: the pieces are larger, controls are limited. It cannot really handle 6 sheets as advertised, and your chances to shred a credit card are below 50%. In almost exactly one year since I purchased it, it developed a problem - it would not stop running after shredding anything and needs to be turn off manually.My advice - don't fall for a cheaper one, buy a better one.P.S. One month later - it stopped working completely, so taking out the second star

  When my old shredder stopped working forever, I procrastinated at first because the last one I bought was expensive and from a name brand that should have been better.  After a couple of nights burning paper in my chimenea outside I knew I had to find a better way to dispose of junk mail with my identity on it.  I went to Amazon this time instead of a local store and chose a 15 sheet Cross-cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder, because it cost less, the reviews were very good, and I knew that Amazon would take it back if I didn't like it.  They will never get it back because this is a fast and quiet machine that does the job perfectly.  I love the pull out bin that can be easily emptied, unlike my old shredder that required lifting a very heavy top completely on and off the machine, giving me not one but two chances at a back breaking exercise.  I love it that the Amazon shredder also came fully assembled, with the casters already attached. It was out of the box and at work right away.  This machine has a very long run time. In fact,  I have never been signaled that it is heating up at all.  I definitely recommend this shredder to anyone who has a lot of shredding to do and will buy another one if I ever need it.

  I have a back load of papers from 10 years ago, so it will be weeks before I'm caught up, but this little shredder has been very good. I didn't go beyond the 6 sheets but that is fine. In the future, what actually has to be shredded wont be as much. I found the overheating function never kicked in and I shredded on and off for 30 minutes or longer. There might have been pauses of 2-3 minutes to look over papers but I found it to be fine with continual use.I also bought the sheets to lubricate teeth and used that once, very easy.I could have gotten a bigger one and more powerful, but for what I will use it for, home use and tax forms, credit cards etc, it is fine.I shred easily 3 credit cards but don't think it can do ones with a chip. My credit card company usually sends a return envelope for them with new card so not a big issue.

  Did its purpose right, for about  6 months.  Theres 3 settings, auto (when you stick paper in it turns on automatically and turns off automatically, off, and reverse for when you have jams.  One morning i woke up and found my machine running by itself and SUPER hot.  CLearly it turned on automatically when i was asleep and i didnt hear or see it until i walked into my garage which is where i keep it.  Definite fire hazard in my opinion given theres a huge deposit of kindle (shredded paper) beneath this.  now i have to just keep on off and turn on when i need to use it.  Great feature on paper for the design team i think, but given it doesnt work properly its actually more dangerous in my opinion..  works, but not correctly.

  I selected a middle of the range shredder, but with a fairly heavy duty construction.  The heavy duty part is hard to assess just from the product description, so I selected the 15-sheet model.  The product meets this expectation hands down.  Its predecessor was an inexpensive Fellowes.  It had plastic tines, and paper shavings would invariably get between the tines and the cutting rollers, clogging the system.  Eventually a few tines broke, rendering the machine unusable.  Also shavings would accumulate on both ends of the chute, causing a jam.I have filled the chute about six times, without a single jam.  The chute in this shredder can be removed by pulling it from the front, very convenient for unloading the shavings.  The Fellowes had just the head and a narrow tub.  The device, being top heavy, would topple easily, spilling its contents.  Unloading the tub was awkward; it required lifting the head, putting it on the floor and then picking up the tub and turning it upside down to empty it.  The Amazon is still top heavy, but it's wider and it has casters, so it won't topple that easily.I haven't tried shredding credit cards or CDs.

  I can honestly say I hate this shredder.  The feed slot is impossibly narrow, trying to feed paper into the shredder is difficult and cumbersome.  The basket is small and fills quickly.  When using this shredder instead of removing a basket to empty you have to remove the heavy shredding unit that sits atop the basket.  This inevitably causes a mess with paper shred.  The shredder is NOT on wheels and is challenging to move.  The shredder is quiet and inexpensive.  You get what you pay for, next time I will select more carefully. I would avoid this unit.

  I purchased this 15-sheet shredder in Dec of 2018 for $109.99. I also purchased the performance oil recommended and maintained it regularly. It has only been just over 1 year and the shredder quit working. There is power all lights come on but no noise from the motor even in reverse. I called the customer service phone number on shredder for Amazon Basics, the manufacturer. The agent, Alonja Green, admitted these 15-sheet shredders are defective but I was out of the one year warranty and flat out told me she can't do anything even though the unit was defective. I was only a year and a little over a month out of warranty. I decided to pay $110 to by this shredder thinking I was getting a good quality shredder that would for sure last for sure more than 1 year. My old shredder lasted over 6 years. DO NOT by any of the cheap quality Amazon Basics products they just don't last and the customer service suck. I know I will not be buying any Amazon Basics products anymore. Extremely disappointed.

  I bought this july 2018, I'm writing this October 2018 and I like this product a lot! I was skeptical buying it honestly, but its a good BASIC shredder. Basically it's TOP heavy it comes a heavy TOP shredder, and the bottom is basically a small waste basket. You can only shred about 5-6 things together but I keep it at 4 cause every time I've done about 6 pages it gets all stuck and I have to keep reversing and pulling it x____x so just have patience with it. If you want a BASIC shredder that just shreds things occasionally (I've been using it just to shred documents with my info) then yes this is a good shredder for you. If you occasionally shred a lot like in the office and such you should get a bigger and better shredder that can do more than just crosscut. This turns the paper into THIN strips but doesn't crosscut the paper into very very little squares. Also a plus is it shreds cards as well (one at a time).features: thin strip cutting, plastic card shredding, reverse switchpros: gets job done 4 papers at a time :Pcons: top heavy (easy to tip), 6 papers max- 4 at a time to be safe (sucks to keep putting it in reverse)uses: occasional shredding of personal documents, in home use (not office use)((a lot of people have said theirs overheated/exploded or something crazy like that. I'm SUPER careful with mine because of those reviews so nothing crazy has happened to me at all! I keep mine unplugged under my desk when not in use and when I use it I plug it in, turn it on, shred, then I turn it back off when Im done and unplug it. If you don't want to be super cautious I advise going for another shredder as well. I haven't been met with any problems but at the same time I use caution while using it.))I hope this review helped!

  I purchased this item and it worked great for a few months. I took all the precautions and followed directions for careful usage with minimal use every few weeks. I thought this was a five-star product and even recommended this shredder to many friends... it's super affordable, not too loud, and I had very little problems with paper jams and other issues I found with other shredders for more than double the price. However, one day, I tried to turn the shredder on and it would not light up at all, not even red to indicate that something was wrong. It seemed the motor had given out randomly despite weeks with no usage. I troubleshot with Amazon online and we had no luck with reviving the shredder... luckily I was under a one-year warranty, and they sent me a new one quickly. The reason I have to give 3 stars is because the replacement shredder was a complete dud, like many have mentioned in these reviews... the shredder worked for 1-2 pieces of paper, then completely stopped working. There were no signs that the motor overheated. It just shut off. I returned it and am now waiting on my refund. It seems like the shredder is great for short-term use, just know that replacements might not be helpful and you might be better off, investing in something with a lifetime guarantee.

  I rarely have to write negative reviews and only do so when it is absolutely necessary.  This is one of those times.  This shredder worked great and did everything it was supposed to.  I would have given it 5 stars.  Until it suddenly stopped working 5 months after purchase.  It doesn't even turn on.  I only used it on a few things about once a week, never jammed it or overheated it.  It just stopped doing anything.  Of course I checked it out using several outlets and made sure it was sitting securely in the bin.  I made sure nothing was stuck in the cutter.  Everything looks fine.  Except it isn't fine because it doesn't work.  Not happy that I will need to buy another one (different brand of course.)

  This shredder replaced one I had for over ten years. The first thing I will say is that it is quiet; it has perhaps only half the noise level of my previous shredder. It has many extra features such as a sensor to let you know when the bin is full. The one significant criticism I have of the shredder itself is the size of the paper feed opening. It is very small for a 15 page shredder, and you have to be very careful in lining the paper up to feed it in. Also, I would change the instruction manual to recommend more frequent use of shredder oil (to every time the bin is emptied), and to recommend that users routinely feed less than the rated shredder capacity to prolong the shredder's life span. All in all I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend it without hesitation.

  First one of these I ordered was returned due to what sounded like a loose screw inside. The second was returned due to cracked plastic near the plug in. Each arrived double boxed and did not appear damaged in shipment. Since I could find no better unit for the money I ordered it a third time. No doubt there is a lot for the money here. A P-4 shredder that can handle 15 pages could easily cost double. Its not a confetti/micro-cut but the pieces are plenty small. The unit isn't as wide as the popular Amazon Basics 12-page shredder, which is what I needed to fit the space I have available. Only time will tell if the unit has the quality to last. Since this is my third, I worry.

  I just returned GBC Paper Shredder, 7 Sheet Capacity, Super Cross-Cut because it stopped working on the second day. I really need a shredder. So I purchased this one, which is about $20 more expensive than GBC. I just opened the package, plugged in, and shredded about 36 car lease statements (two sheets each and about 1/3 of it folded. So a part of each was 4 sheets thick). I unfolded the first one and separated it into two sheets before feeding it, just like I was doing with GBC. I was surprised by how quiet it was and fast. So I fed the next one as it was, folded two-sheet statement. It went through as quiet and as fast.  And a much larger bin. Definitely it was worth more than $20 addition cost.  Highly recommended. If I find something new about it, I will add to this review in the future.

  This shredder is very quiet compared to multiple other shredders. It is small, sits on a table in our home office. The tray is not large so if you are shredding a lot of documents, you need to empty the tray frequently. However, it does a great job shredding. There are no problems with staples left in documents. The tray fits easily inside a tall kitchen garbage bag for transport to your recycling center- my previous shredder was from my office and much larger but was a mess when I attempted to drain to reasonable size bag for emptying. If your want this for home use, this is perfect. Great value for the price paid. If you are shredding a lot of material or want to use in a larger office, you would need to get a bigger machine. All previous machines were purchased at Staples and I like this machine much better.

  Does everything it should and does them well.  Nice rollers enable it to be kept under a desk and rolled out to do shredding.  I think the machine will last much longer if fewer than 15 sheets of 20# paper are shredded at one time.  My PREVIOUS shredder caused a loud pop from my audio system when it started and stopped.  This one DOES NOT.  I suspect that most paper that is shreded is perhaps 24# which means something like 10 to 12 sheets is the maximum.  My fist use involved a massive shredding job and by limiting the number of sheets to 6 I had no overheat shutdowns and the subsequent wait to begin again.  Shreds credit cards CDs/DVDs very well.  Downgraded from 5 stars to 4 stars because of 1)the delay time to shred the first page (may be the reason for no popping from my audio system); 2) a few annoying shreds are left in the bottom of the machine after removing the bin for emptying; and 3) bin removal would be easier if the locking tabs were slightly larger.  No deal breakers there just wanted you to know.

  This shredder arrived on the date promised and was packaged very well so as to not be damaged.  It has several really nice features that I have not seen before.  For one thing ,there is a window on the front so I can easily see how full the basket is getting.  The basket itself is very large and I love this because I don't have to stop as frequently to empty it.  The safety features are really helpful; for example, letting you know if the door is not fully closed; if the machine is overloaded; and if there are any surge interference.You can shred up to 15 sheets at a time; however, I won't be doing that as I think it's better just to do 2-3 and not risk getting something jammed or overworking the grinder/teeth.The shredder is on wheels and easily moves around to your desired spot and the cord is nice and long.The only negative I could find is in the switch itself that you slide to the left to turn the machine on or off or to use reverse or forward.  It doesn't glide to the side easily and is just made of plastic so it is something I will be sure to move carefully without force of any kind so that it doesn't break.  This may be a non-issue really but is just something I have noticed so thought worth mentioning.  Overall, thank you Amazon for once again, providing me with quality items.  You always come through!

  Bought four years ago. Worked fine, so long as I didn't try to put too much paper through it. Knowing the limits, there are still times I ended up putting too much thickness into the shredder. It would slow/stop and I'd remove the offending thickness and proceed. About 6 months ago it ground to a halt and nothing I do will make it run again. I even, against all label warnings, disassembled the shredding unit to try to find the problem. No paper remains in the unit, no overheating, also no reset button. I have a good-size piece of junk to now toss in the trash. It's a small thing, this shredder, in the larger scheme of waste, but I'll buy something different this time in hope that it will last a decade or more. I shouldn't have to toss this much simple machinery so soon.

  Mixed review. It's inexpensive. It does a nice job of cross-cutting. Seems to bog down on more than one page at a time, especially on more than two, so I hope it lasts. It says it can handle 6 sheets. If you plan on feeding 6 at a time, my suggestion is start doing it the minute you get it; don't wait until the warranty runs out to see if it can handle it. This is just a casual use machine for me and I'm OK with a couple sheets at a time. If you want something for high volume, this isn't it.My biggest beef with this shredder is the extremely narrow throat. If you have a stiff paper, can see the top of the shredder, and can guide the paper straight into the thin slot, you're good. If you plan to have this under a desk and want to just be able to reach under without looking, forget about it. Buy something else. I keep this one out in the open and don't have too much trouble getting papers in the throat, but a slightly higher-end one that looks almost identical is under my desk and it drives me nuts. The one I used to have was easy to feed; this design is crazy. Whoever designed it obviously had no intention of it ever being placed anywhere you couldn't look the paper into the slot. It's like trying to throw a ball through a hole at one of those carnival games. Good luck!

  I bought this 4 years ago for light duty work (mostly mail). For this it excels. If you have large quantities of paper to shed, you'll need to be patient as the shredder takes 3 to 6 pages at a time and will turn itself off once it becomes hot and take some time to turn back on. Noise is reasonable; much quieter than some others shredders I've had but still noisy. It can handle credit cards (individually) and papers with staples just fine.I'm currently shredding a massive amount of paper (legal files; don't marry someone for the wrong reasons). A sane person would drop off this amount, but I've decided to push through. I typically shred three sheets at a time (this shredder can supposedly do 6). This seems like a good balance between speed and not taxing the shredder. During this process I noticed it was becoming more sluggish and making an occasional knocking/clicking sound. I attempted to clean out all the paper fragments but clearing the corners seemed impossible. I believe the buildup in the corners was causing the sluggishness and knocking.I decided to disassemble the unit to remove the buildup. First thing to note, one of the screws holding the case together is covered by a little ""will void warranty"" sticker; you'll need to (re)move it to access this last screw. After opening the case take note of where things go -- in particular the mechanical sensor. You'll need to remove 4 more screws to remove the core shredding unit from one side of the plastic case. I used some screw drivers to slowly wedge them apart. Once separated I was able to remove the built-up wad of hardened paper jammed in the corners of the plastic case. I also took this opportunity to vacuum the inside a bit and pull out bits of paper with needle nose pliers. Take note the gears on the side are greasy so try not to touch them.After this I put it back together. The mechanical sensor took a second as it is connects with wires to one half of the case but slides into place on the other. Now the shredder sounds much better and more powerful. I'm hoping those corners don't get jammed again any time soon. Four years later I can say I'm very satisfied with this purchase.

  I primarily bought this to get rid of sensitive mail and prescription bags. They are a nightmare for privacy and have your name printed 20 times in 20 places in 20 sizes. Don't need people knowing the medication I'm on. Regardless, this gets the job done. Just don't plan on using it early morning/late night if you have roommates.Updated review: Purchased in March 2020. Never went past the recommended amount of shredding in both time used and amount shredded at once. I always removed the staples. Never did extreme type of paper, just computer paper. Never did stickers. I did a debit card just once. Overall, it was a great purchase at first but 5 months later, the sensors have stopped working. I truly tried troubleshooting it for 20 minutes or so and it just only feeds in through one side, making it a janky experience. I should also note - I was initially going to be refunded entirely for this product, but due to taking a phone call, I could not respond in time to the offer. No problem, right? An agent will just pick up where we left all. After coming back to the customer service chat window, I was then told the original offer would not be honored because Anna, my customer service rep, should not have done that. And she would be reported because she actually was going to fix my issue.I try my absolute best to not immediately return or dump items if I see that they can be repaired. But this is now a giant waste of space and paperweight. I will still keep it, because I dont want to see it in a landfill.

  Purchased this shredder about two years ago and it just stopped working a couple months ago. I don't understand why, I've kept theachine clean and lubricated. When I reached out to customer service, they basically said there was nothing they could do to help. After reading many reviews on many shredders, I chose this one because of the price and the praises. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PAPER SHREDDER!! It worked just fine for a long time, but even with care, it will let you down as much as customer service let me down. I've been an Amazon prime member for years now and this is what I get?

  I came home last night to the sound of my shredder running, seemingly by itself. While set to ""auto"" mode, it triggered itself (no paper in the bin on or top of it) and must have been running all night. The motor inside was overheating and very hot to the touch. Switching it to ""off"" did not stop it, so I had to unplug it.While writing this review, I decided to plug it in now that it had time to cool. Within a few moments it triggered itself again while in the ""auto"" mode. Even removing the top section (which should trigger the safety mechanism to shut off the shredder) did not stop it.That being said, it did not show any signs of malfunction for a least a year and a half or so. I still wouldn't trust it.

  We had a mailmate that suddenly quit on us.  We got this one and lubed it up with the Fellows shredder lubricant oil.  You must oil it before first use.  The machine sings with fresh lube.  With this shredder placed on a waist level bookcase, I was able to destroy one whole, overflowing laundry basket full of papers within one day and not worry about my little kids getting fingers hurt.  I sorted my papers out so they'd fit into the entry slot, put only 4-6-8 pages in a bundle and kept shredding until the basket was full, then I emptied the can and resumed. I oiled it by putting oil between several pieces of paper, every so often. Use your ear to hear the machine; it'll tell you when it needs more oil.  I ended up with three 13gallon trash bags full and was so freaking satisfied. The overheat light never came on once.  It will also shred corrugated cardboard pieces and the mail labels stuck to shipping bags. Sticky labels between two regular papers are no problem.  Stick your FedEx/UPS, prescription bottle labels on your junkmail and shred away!  Save yourself the $$ and buy this shredder!

  I chose this shredder mostly due to the good reviews and the price point. It would have been significantly more expensive to jump up to the next size shredder with good reviews. That being said, due to my shredding habits, I probably should have sprung for the larger model.If you are a person that is really good at consistently keeping up on your shredding then this is a great option for you. It is a very compact unit that is classic looking and it gets the job done with no issues.I, on the other hand, am someone that hoards documents until I can't stand to stare at them anymore and then I shred them all at once. The issue with this is this shredder can only do comfortably about 4-6 sheets at once depending on the paper. The bin is very small and fills up fast when shredding large quantities and the machine will overheat if used for more than 10-15 minutes non-stop.Again, my issues with this shredder are far less about the machine itself and more about my specific shredding habits. If you hold onto documents and do a lot of shredding at once than I would recommend sizing up.

  Great shredder for the price. Although it’s not micro cross cut, it is more than adequate for home/home office use. The only reason this doesn’t get 5 stars is because I feel the basket is too small. When I go on a shredding spree, I find that I have to empty it pretty often. Additionally, for shredding sprees, the shredder overheats fair quickly. But I’m not going to complain since it’s under $30. My older shredder is more than double the price. I can overlook some of its flaws at this price range. And tip to those who are knew to the shredder world, get yourself a quality shredder oil for a few bucks (which will last you years) to keep the shredder operating at tip top condition.

  Bought this awhile back. Worked great. Chews thru paper with ease. However, there is a switch for it to always be ""ready/auto."" Just stick the paper in and it will start on its own. This was fine until after a year+ it suddenly was running on its own. I was home by myself, not in my office space, when I heard this constant buzzing. Ran around and found it was this paper shredder, cranking away on its own. Nothing was in it. There was no feasible reason for it start running. It hadn't been used in awhile, either (weeks).  Thankfully I was home because this might have started on fire. The unit was obviously running for a bit and was uncomfortably hot to the touch with a hot smell. Now, whenever I put it back to ""auto"" it just starts running on its own. I keep it off now until I need it.

  I wore out a Fellowes shredder after many years. This looked like a good deal for a cross-cut shredder and indeed it was. Works fine, as expected. Shreds into pretty much paper mush. I don't run more than three sheets at a time, though; that seems to be a reasonable upper limit. After a straight hour's shredding it never overheated.Can't complain one bit.

  I settled on the AmazonBasics 15 Sheet Shredder after a few months and diligently perusing hundreds of reviews. I did purchase the extended warranty plan as the reliability of these machines is often unpredictable. First impressions were very favorable. The shredder arrived in a very well designed double-boxed configuration that itself was in perfect condition, no dents or tears in the sturdy heavy wall corrugated construction.  This was a pleasant surprise considering the listed weight of this machine. It even feels balanced and manageable in its double box configuration.Anyway, unboxed, power-up and began shredding in just a few minutes with no issues whatsoever. I managed to process about 15 pounds of assorted documents, unopened credit solicitation mail and various other flyers and junk. Shredder ran smooth and quietly for at least 40 minutes without jamming or overheating and could have run longer but that I ran out of material to process through it. The machine is very quiet, stable and easily mobile with the heavy duty pre-installed casters. There is no noticeable shred motor strain running 3-4 sheets but it slows a tiny bit at 5 sheets+ or full junk-mail envelopes reducing them to non-readable, reconstruction proof shreds. Still, it grinds effortlessly and continuously with double or triple sheets and single/double thick stock. I've only had this machine for a short while but I'm confident of its longevity all considered. This is by far one of the better quality and quietest shredders available for the cost. The waste basket capacity is impressive and emptying it is a breeze. IMHO, this is a GREAT value shredder for home or small office environment. I recommend first reading a good variety of reviews, purchasing the extended warranty, a good preventative maintenance oil and also retaining the double box package just in case you need to ship back as an RMA.

  My rating is colored a bit by the fact that my previous shredder was great (until it died after 6 years of hard use).  But I find this shredder very loud.  It doesn't overheat, but I'd rather have one that was quiet.  It's also pretty slow, meaning it takes a lot longer for a single stack of papers to get shredded.The mouth of the shredder is a bit narrow (meaning you have to align your stack of papers exactly or it will be too wide to go in).  Also, the way the paper is deposited in the bin means that the shredder always stops (saying it's ""full"") when its really less than 2/3 full.  So you open the bin and floof the paper around and keep going a while.  If the bin is anything like full, pulling the bin out scrapes shreddies into the inside of the shredder, for a small mess.It's interesting that the credit cards and CDs go in the same slot as the paper, but since you can't recycle plastic and paper together, it doesn't help much.  Also I find that shredding CDs in this makes a bit of a mess.The sensor for the auto-start is slow, and it sometimes makes the shredder stop too early, so I just use the always-on instead.Unless I've been surprisingly lucky, this machine is pretty good about not getting jammed.So I'll use it until it breaks, but I wouldn't buy another one.

  I have had a shredder about 10 years that works great, but would only shred two or three pages at a time.  It was time consuming if I had a lot of papers so I decided to purchase a new shredder.  This one is supposed to handle 12 pages of 20 lb. paper.  It worked great on a few pages, but when I tried 12 pages it jammed.  I have been trying to unjam the shredder all afternoon.  I just received the shredder last night and this was only the second time that I used it.  My other shredder also has a much larger opening for the paper.  The paper has to be perfectly straight across the bottom before you can feed it into this shredder.  Right now I'm not happy, but time will tell.

  I know alot of folks write a review JUST AFTER receiving an item, but what also counts (or maybe counts MORE) is what happens after you've had a product for a while.  Well we bought 2 of these and while 1 lasted a little longer than the other, they have both completely died now.  The trouble starts when the ""auto"" setting no longer worked on both of them.  You could only shred if you turned it on manually.  Eventually that option too stopped working on both.  I am not a mechanic, but I did look for paper jams.  I did the best I could.  The motor will still work in backwards motion, but that does not do us any good for shredding.  I would NOT purchase again.  We have another, older model from another company that is still going strong!  I like Amazon but in this case, the product is not built well.  Off to the landfill unfortunately!

  I'm sad to say that I am very dissatisfied with this shredder.  I use this shredder for home use to shred old paper bills (most of my bills are electronic, so I only have a few papers that need shredding.)  You cannot shred more than 3 pages at a time (product says 6 pages max), the shredder overheats after using it a few times and will not turn back on for 30 minutes. After I read all the good reviews, I was shocked at the poor performance of this machine.  I would highly recommend that you choose another shredder to buy.

  The Shredder is listed as a light/medium duty but I used it to shred a lot when I first used it. So far it has done a great job shredding. I've run two box loads of old documents (8 1/2"" x 11"" sheets of paper piled about 18"" high) thru the shredder. Enough to fill five 13 gallon trash bags of firmly compacted shreds. I never ran the eight max sheets but kept it to five of less. With thicker sheets, I just ran a single sheet thru. I also tried to avoid running staples thru even though it's OK to do so. The machine never jammed or overheated and turned itself off. I never ran it more than 3 minutes at a time anyways and would use it sporadically to not overheat it. The feed slot is at an angle but you get used to it quickly. The sensor is electronic, not a flimsy plastic tab sticking out triggered by a sheet of paper. To keep it oiled I just poured some mineral oil on a sheet of paper and ran it thru the cutters.The switch has a lot of side to side play but it does the job. It does have a decent click when seated in one of three positions. Auto, Off, or Reverse. The 4.1 gallon bin is a little soft and flimsy so handle it carefully. The window is nice to see how full the bin is getting. A little gentle shaking helps settle the shreds down as you go. The thinner the paper the better job it does crosscutting. Still it shreds enough for home use. The handle makes emptying the bin a lot easier.

  Bought this about 10 months ago, and it seemed to be working fine until it wouldn't even turn on. When I called the toll free customer service number conveniently provided on the top of the unit - guess what - it was fine - I just hadn't made sure the half moon shaped piece of plastic on the back of the unit was over the edge of the bucket. This meant that the safety cut-off switch wasn't disengaged, which meant the unit wouldn't work BECAUSE of SAFETY! LOL This was the first question the customer service rep asked me, so I'm not the only person who has called. So before you give this unit a bad review, check out that you're using it correctly!

  Less than a year it completely broke. The covers themselves broke around the screws.I get things break but less than a year isn't a good sign.I decided to get the 8 page version of this but have about a year before I review that one. Stay tuned!

  I bought this shredder so I could stop sharpie-ing my bank account numbers before ripping them up and putting them in two separate trash bags :P It's also good for those fake credit cards you get in the mail, etc.It arrived within 24 hours, and I assembled it in 5 seconds. Just put the top on, plugged it in, and it was ready to go!Noisy? Eh, not much more than your average shredder. Plus, I don't typically do my shredding at 3 in the morning, so who cares?Works great, no complaints. Takes an extra few seconds for the cross-cut, which is well worth the extra security. Storage size/amount is very practical.All-in-all what I was hoping for. Highly recommend it!

  This is a nice shredder!We are happy that this shredder is quiet, efficient and handles multiple sheets of paper well. It states that it can shred continuously for 20 minutes before it needs to cool down - and so far we have not seen it overheat while doing batches of mail containing credit card solicitations, etc. The shreds are nice and small and the bin lets us use a bag to catch the shreds. The unit we were sent had a broken caster - but contacting Amazon resulted in a speedy resolution that we are happy about.I would recommend this unit for home use. So far we have not shredded continuously for 20 minutes so have not seen how it handles once it gets overheated. However, our old shredder overheated and jammed all the time - so this is really a great improvement. Very satisfied thus far. I think it would work well in light office use also.

  When I received this shredder, I put it through the paces for sure.  I had been hoarding about 5 years of documents that needed to be shredded.  (This in all was about five trash bags full of shredded paper.)  The shredder did overheat and shut off a few times, which is a welcomed safety feature to me considering the flammability of its contents.  Other than that, it was smooth sailing.  The shredder never jammed and shredded multiple pages at a time effortlessly.  In addition, it was able to shred credit cards as advertised.I now use the shredder on a weekly basis and have not had any issues at all.  I would recommend this product to anyone needing the peace of mind that comes with shredding all those documents you don't want to fall into the wrong hands.  With that being said, I do use this shredder in my home for personal use only.  I am not sure how well it holds up in a business setting.

  Forget 8 sheet... it has been jamming with 4 or 5... and will not take an unopened prepaid credit card offer, which in my opinion should be the standard.Largely 2 stars because once this thing gets jammed... it is almost impossible to unjam because of the plastic silver/white cover over the shred blades put there for your protection.... I had 5 pieces of paper end up getting pulled crooked and it jammed. The fragment of paper that caused the jam was positioned so you can't get to it from the top or the bottom, and the unit immediately refuses to operate, the ""Overheat"" light comes on which isn't really an overheat.. just means it has detected a jam and refuses to try to power through it because it might overheat. The only way to get to the blades to actually clear the jam would be to void the warranty by removing the last screw to open the top unit up.My suggestion is to skip a shredder... just throw it all on the Webber... fire never jams.

  I bought this specifically for preparing cardboard to be composted. The unit is powerful and has no problem shredding down cardboard boxes. My only complaint is that during normal operations the unit will frequently stop running and indicate that the bin is full when it is not. Tapping on the top of the machine causes it to resume shredding. I suspect there is a faulty connection or sensor causing the issue. I didn’t want to bother with returning it so I am just using it. If it stops working entirely I will take it apart and disable the bin full sensor. It is a powerful and relatively inexpensive shredder for cardboard that apparently has poor quality control.

   Reviewing the 12-sheet Amazon Basics paper shredder. In picture: small Aurora 4-sheet shredder (AS420C) and 7-gallon (15-inch-tall) recycling bin included for size reference. Black 12-sheet shredder is in the middle. This thing eats cardboard easily. Great shredder. Not too tall, not too small. The capacity is generous. A little bit too much for my needs, but I highly recommend it for anyone who has big piles of paper needing to be shredded. It's a little loud but not too bad, but it is super heavy. (But not necessarily heavier than the average 12-sheet shredder I assume, so don't let that steer you away) I'm going to stick with the 4-sheet Aurora shredder because even though it can't handle the thick Amazon-box cardboard like this 12-sheet shredder can, it's at least strong enough to cut through thin-style cardboard.

  This shredder is advertised and sold as a cross shredder but I noticed it is not.  In fact, when I looked at the small shredded pieces I could see a good part of personal info like my name, account numbers etc.  All it does Is cut the papers into to small rectangular pieces. After doing research I see I should get a micro shredder. That too takes research.

  Very good value for this Amazon Basic cross cutter.  States 12 sheets of 20-lb bond paper tho that's chancing everyone knows the limits of that.  I've tried that but it's pushing it a bit considering you have 7-min max limit to then allow a cool down period of 30-min.  Granted most aren't going to be purging years, if so this isn't the right model.  Periodic as mail comes in or a weekly shredding is plenty good and make sure to get proper lubricant to keep it running sharp.  I'm a but lazy as I buy the prepped sheets with lubricant and sharpening properties.  I'd had liked outside bucket handles to carry both the shredder and bucket, but you can't have it all on a value model, tho having what's important is provided.  Read the instructions thoroughly before using is the best advice given.  I'm a fan and user of this product.  Thank you for reading.

  So I decided I wanted to get a paper shredder, just to shred the junk mail I’ve been getting lately. I saw this, and the price was enticing and I figured 8-sheet was more than enough for the 3 or 4 letters I get a day. So after going through my mail, opening them up and all, I started shred them one by one. I got to the third letter when I started to smell like something was burning. So I stopped, and unplugged it. I was a little surprised by what happened, and decided I’ll deal with this later when I get home from work. Once I got home, I plugged it back in and stuck the last letter in. The burning smell came back almost immediately, and I saw smoke coming up from where I put in the letter. I immediately unplugged it, with the letter still visible in the slot.I contacted Amazon customer service, which the offered to send a replacement but I’m to wary about getting another one of the same model. Maybe I’ll invest in one that’s a little more powerful, perhaps 8-sheet wasn’t enough for junk mail. I want to make it clear, it’s not like I was shoving thick unopened letters in the shredder. I opened the letters, took out the contents, reviewed them, and then shredded the contents which a max is three pages. If I was shoving unopened letters, I would have put partial blame on myself. However, that’s not the case.I would maybe invest in one slightly stronger model, because 8-sheet just didn’t cut it for 3-sheets.

   The shredder top portion was heavier than I had imagined but my 42 lbs kiddo could lift it up. It also has a carry area so make it easy too. I like the see through window to see how full basket is. If you look at my photos you’ll see the awesome safety guard. You can’t stick a finger in it so with kids it’s awesome! I haven’t seen a lower costing shredder have that kind of feature on it.A bit noisy but not the worst I’ve heard; refer to video for sound level.I haven’t pushed the 8 sheets max but use common sense if you’re using thicker paper or light weight card stock or not unfolding your paper.You could probably place a 4g trash bag for easy collection but I am not since I’ll be dumping in a paper bag for recycling.For $42.xx I like it but I just got it. I may revise review at a later date. You can definitely find cheaper working ones for the same price but this seems good for a general household use.

  Very nice, solid shredder and I am most happy with it.  The instructions were illuminating.  They tell you NOT to have a plastic bag in the bucket, but few people will not be putting a bag in there for ease of disposal.  Also, they tell you NOT to put anything through the machine that has any adhesives on it.  I, for one, shred everything with my name, address or sensitive information on it including labels from my prescription bottles and from packages.  These things all have adhesive on them.  One wonderful thing I learned from the instructions is how to use cooking oil to possibly clear up a jam, and it works.  Using cooking oil, I have got my old shredder (the one this new one was to replace) working.  I will use the old one for things with adhesives (and periodic cooking oil treatment) and this new one for paper without adhesives.  Win over all for me.

  I bought this shredder & specifically chose it because it said cross cut,  but it seems to cut very standard instead.  I had another shredder that lasted a few years and that one cut in much finer pieces.  The shredder does appear to work well enough  for everyday papers & junk mail  but check if you're  shredding anything that needs more security.Another issue I had was the shredding for credit cards.  I put some old cards in it and it did shred it  but when I looked at the pieces it had very readable information  like full names in the cut up pieces.  Another issue I had was I had plastic cards like medical id cards that  were slightly bigger than credit cards that this shredder was able to cut slightly but not shred.Pros:  so far shreds easily & smoothly.Cons:  pieces are larger than some other shredders .  Sometimes information can be read from shredded pieces.  Will not shred plastics larger than a credit card.

  the paper entry slot is extremely thin and very angled.  rather than a typical shredder where the slot is open and accessible.  so you have to struggle to get the paper down the slot at just the right angle.  the paper of course won't cooperate so you're forced to keep tearing the paper out and trying over and over again to get it to shred.  not worth the hassle even if it was free.

  Well-made, sturdy, and it is powerful.  Perfect for dropping those never-ending credit card apps and other junk mail with fake credit cards with our names and info already on them.  Although I highly recommend you open those and see if they have provided a return envelope with prepaid postage and shred it all and then put it all in that envelope and mail it back to them!  Bwaaaaah!  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because it had trouble shredding the AARP junk mail because as we all know, they waste members' money on these thick junk mailings with several thick plastic ID cards in the envelope already made out in our name.

  When left in auto mode, this shredder has the propensity to start grinding all by itself without being prompted by anyone inserting paper. The troubleshooting guide tells you to clean the sensors if you have problems like this — so the fact that the sensor can malfunction and turn the motor on randomly is a known issue and design flaw. Problem is, the shredder can start doing this at any time. It could do it in the middle of the night when you're sleeping. It could do it when you're not home. And when it does this, it will not stop grinding and will eventually overheat itself.It is absolutely a fire hazard. I'm lucky I've been home the times when mine started doing this, because this last time, it was smoking when I got to it. Do NOT leave this shredder in auto-mode, if you're going to use it. Or better yet, find a better shredder.

  The AmazonBasics cross-cut paper shredder is almost exactly like the Aurora model it replaced. But has a few helpful new features: overheat alert and automatic shutdown, a handle on top (other side of intake) for lifting the shredder off the bin, and most important: eats staples. It sits silently under the desk, turning on automatically when I feed it. The directions clearly tell users not to use it for paper, envelopes or cards that have anything sticky on them. The item may go through easily, but shreds will stick to the machine's teeth for all time. Tape, that rubbery glue they stick on the back of (credit or membership) cards, empty stamp sheets -- don't do it. The last straw for my previous shredder was the rubbery goo on the back an unwanted card I couldn't catch in time. A shredder is essential these days. I'm very happy with this AmazonBasics shredder.

  A couple of years ago, I looked at my checking account balance and found most of my money gone. I went online and saw that it was taken by ""Government of"" a country that never existed. Though I was reimbursed by my bank, it took weeks to get the money back. Not fun when you are an old fart like me, on a fixed income and then sweat just to get your cat his food.I bought one of those security ink stampers but noticed that even after multiple stamping, you could still make out important information, especially if you held a letter at an angle to a strong light. It was most notable on correspondence printed with a laser printer.Granted, I've only had this shredder for a few days. So far, it's fantastic. Turns my paper into confetti. I should have gotten this years ago.UPDATE : It's amazing how many things that you receive have your name, address and a bar code with only god knows what info is in that it you get. It really is a treasure trove for a thief. Preapproved offers of credit, I have learned, are a gold mine for the bad guys. Even a receipt from a store, if you paid with anything other than cash, will have a ton of info on it. Shred the damn paper.

  I bought this to shred those Credit Card Application and ads.  Which I only check my mail once a week so I only use the shredder once a week.  I don't think it is made to handle very thick mail or a lot of papers at once, so if I don't open the letter and then it will have a little hard time to shred (some didn't shred right if I do it like that).  I just needed to open them up and shred about 8 sheets (as it said) then it does what I asked for.  I only had it over heat once because that was at the beginning when I don't open up my letters before i put them in. But it hasn't over hear since I change the way I use it.  IF you need to shred hundreds or thousand pages a day then this might not be good for your need.  People like me only do a few sheets a time then this is good for it.  It is quite loud and that is the only complain I have for it.  Otherwise with the price and what I used for is a great purchase for me.

  I purchased this shredder for business to shred documents for disposal in 2017. Our prior shredder lasted more than a decade. This one only lasted a little over a year and a half and I am disappointed. Paper began to clog the rollers and late yesterday, it died. I believed that it would last a few more years, but it didn't. We didn't abuse it or do anything unusual so I'm surprised it is now dead. You can make your own conclusions about this unit but my experience was underwhelming.

  I used this shredder when I first got it and it worked just fine. I had about 100 pages with personal info to dispose of. I never went over the page limit and took my time shredding it all- it worked just fine. The trouble came about a month later, when I had another stack of paper to shred. I plugged it in and tried to shred a paper and it didn't work. No lights indicating a fault or anything else. The blades certainly weren't jammed and the reverse switch position didn't do anything either. I verified my outlet was working properly. I came back here and saw there were several recent reviews describing the same sort of thing happening to them. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this shredder- you'll end up with a broken piece of junk outside of your window for return.

  After I burned up my previous shredder by overloading it I researched the best crosscut shredders for home use.  This one consistently showed up in various electronic review articles as a great value.  It does a good job and has yet to overheat or jam (but I am more careful now as to how many pages I load and for how long I use it before giving it a break).  The only negative for me is that you have to lift the shredder head off of the bin to empty it.  This is a bit awkward but not a deal breaker.  My previous shredder (may it rest in peace) had a bin that would slide out for ease of emptying.  So far this shredder is keeping up with my demands.  I recently shredded financial documents from my mother's estate that I no longer needed to hold on to.  The shredder kept up the pace until I gave it a rest after emptying the bin twice (I gave it the rest - it did not demand one).

  I have not had much negative experience purchasing things from Amazon (items sold by Amazon, fulfilled by Amazon or AmazonBasics items). Bought this item just 3 months ago and have used it only thrice so far. Today being the third time, after shredding 10 sheets of papers, it stopped working. Thought it's an overheating issue just like any other shredder I have owned in the past. But it did not get fixed after several attempts with several minutes to few hours cooling time.The third party company was willing to send a replacement but requires me to take care of the shipping cost to ship my current item to their center (probably a norm). But I don't think it's worth spending $10+ for an unit that costs $30 and taking the risk of owning another unit of the same product.Would never buy this item -- probably another AmazonBasics -- again.

  Great shredder. It shreds credit cards safely. I tried 12 pages and it took it down easily (it is new and blades are still sharp). Later on I do not expect it to able to keep up with 12 page shredding, at least not without maintenance. The machine part is just sitting on top of the bin. Easy to knock over is you put it near high foot traffic. No locking mechanism to keep machine locked onto the bin. You have to be becareful lifting it. I sometimes forget and the paper shreds spills all over. Overall, good machine for the price. Amazom 1 year waranty included so shred like crazy in year 1 =)

  This review is for the cross-cut, 8-page shredder.  I used this to shred about 40 pounds of old records and had no problems.  It took about 4 hours, working 45 minutes at a time to save my body, not because the shredder needed to rest.  It never stopped due to overheating.  I was careful to avoid feeding too many pages or feed them in crookedly.  It's rated for 8 pages but that seems optimistic, especially if you have heavy-grade paper.  With 6 pages of ""normal"" paper it was already laboring and I didn't want to jam it.  I tried to keep it to 2-3 pages at a time.  That way I could feed them nearly continuously so it was still reasonably fast.  I paused every minute or so to remove staples, arrange the next batch to feed, etc.  It could handle light staples but I removed most of them so I could control the page count.The shredded paper makes an excellent packing material.  You could pour it into a carton to protect the contents but we instead enclosed it in the small non-recyclable plastic bags we accumulate from our newspaper home-delivery subscription.  Less of a mess that way when unpacking the carton it's protecting.

  After having my third debit card number stolen, I decided I needed to be more careful with my personal information and I figured shredding important documents was a good place to start. This one is more basic but It does the job. I don't need to be shredding mass amounts of paper- although the amount of spam mail coming through makes the 8 paper limit annoying sometimes. I like that it can shred my cards! Since my debit card number was fraudulently used- I had to get rid of the original one after reordering a new one. Before that, I would just hold on to them and keep it in a box- expired and ""lost"" ones. Now I have a better way of getting rid of them.My only teeeny complaint is the design. I don't like that the whole top part is the shredding machine and isn't secured onto the bin. If I need to move the whole shredder, I need to pick it up from the bin, which can be a bit inconvenient since it's under my table. I have to bend over and carefully move it because the top is so heavy. One time I didn't have a good grip on it and the whole thing toppled, sending shredded paper all over the floor. It was messy! I also imagine this could be a safety issue if you have curious kids who might play with it because the blades are all exposed as soon as you lift the machine off the bin.

  Bought this to replace a 10-year-old Fellowes that died.  Roughly 33% cheaper than the comparable new Fellowes and so far a great buy.  Shredded 12 ""shredder bags"" full today when I got it and it performed well.  Couple of tips:  (1) the thin Fellowes shredder bags #36052 work fine with this shredder--available on Amazon for roughly 22 cents each (box of 100 for $22)--secure the back of the bag in the hole in the back of the bin; (2) when the shredder says ""bin full,"" you can get roughly 50% more in the bag by taking out the basket and pushing down on the shreds.  With luck it will last through the rest of my big shredding project--15 years of useless records...

   I purchased this shredder for home use because I work in special education and need to shred confidential documents regularly.  I keep this in my basement so its out of disturbance range from my family, so I really wasn't concerned with the ""noise"" factor upon purchase.  Because most of the documents I shred have staples, I was excited to buy an inexpensive home office shredder that could tackle staples as well.  I included a video shredding a 10-page document with a staple so you an see and hear how the machine works.  Here's the run-down on pros/cons:Pros:Small and easy to ""hide"" in your officeRelatively quiet compared to my last shredderMicroshredded paper takes up less room inside the storage basketWindow view to see how when it's time to emptySimple to put together and operateWon't run if the top isn't on correctly (nice safety feature)Shreds 7-10 pages with easeShreds staples with no problemsCons:Becomes more laborious for 10 pages and upStorage container for shreds is very small and needs to be emptied oftenAs you can see, the cons are minimal and really depend on the type of shredding you do.  If you're shredding 12-page documents regularly, I'd go with a bigger, higher-capacity unit because this many pages begins to sound labored in this shredder.  If you're like me and shred 7-10 page documents, it works great.  If you're shredding every day, you might consider a bigger unit so you're not emptying the shredded paper constantly.  Hope this helps!

  I have been wanting a shredder for home use and now that I am teleworking most days I was looking for a cost effective smaller shredder. It has a good look and does shred, however if you plan on shredding anything more than a couple of bills and a credit card now and then, you may want to consider something a little more heavy duty. I would like to see the opening a little wider, as you have to align the paper perfectly to get it into the shredder.Pros: - Small and compact  - Shreds Credit Cards  - Nice Look  - Light weight  - Reasonably pricedCons: - Its states it shreds 8 sheets. This is a  stretch, I shredded 8 and it jammed  multiple times. I recommend 4-5 sheets.  max.  - Being that it is light weight, it tips over  easily.  -The lids does not secure well.This makes it  easy to empty, however if it tips over you  will have a parade of shredded paper in  the room.

  Purchased this paper shredder to help me dispose of a large number of old, sensitive documents that I had been accumulating for over a decade. Despite running this large number of documents through the shredder, I never hit the over heating limit because it exceeded my limit for tedium. I regularly fed documents, five at a time, through the machine for 15 minutes over the course of several days to dispose of all of these documents.I continue to use this shredder on a regular basis to prevent the accumulation of unnecessary sensitive documents. Never had any issues and I'm all around satisfied with the product. Have used the credit card shredding feature to dispose of old cards and that works flawlessly.Lastly, I think this product is a great value. Had considered buying a more expensive model as my parents have had issues with cheaper shredders over the years. Yet I decided to take a chance on the Amazon Basics offering because I've always been satisfied my purchases from this brand. Glad I did as this shredder totally meets my needs.

  I love this shredder & it’s exactly what I was hoping for. I bought this to replace my old shredder that was always getting jammed & over heated with in a couple minutes of shredding. This new shredder is fast & I was able to shred whole unopened junk mail within seconds. I had so much piled up to shred because my old shredder couldn’t handle it but this new shredder definitely was able to handle the load. I had an hours worth of shredding to do & this shredder never overheated or jammed. The bin is a good size as well & i do use a trash bag to help keep it clean. I only had to empty it out 2 times. I do suggest when it tells you bin is full just open it & the papers will settle to the bottom so you are able to completely fill the trash bag to the maximum. Then just grabbed the trash bag & toss without getting any pieces on the floor. It also has wheels on the bottom & rolls easy on carpet floors. This shredder is worth every penny & I recommend it.

  Purchased this after my old machine of 12 years stopped fully functioning whereas only the ""reverse feed"" switch option would work not the ""autofeed"" which was the only option to use the shred feature. So glad that this has ""On,"" ""autofeed,"" ""reverse,"" and ""Off"" switch options, this adverts the problem I had with my old document shredder which could very powerfully reverse but as the sensor for auto feed failed it lacked a manual switch for ""ON"" operation.This device, definitely not high quality or silent, however the blades are sharp. The motor overheats after about 30 minutes of use (for scale: roughly only a grocery store paper bag full of paper documents---no plastic film, credit cards or foils) and the device shuts down in which the user will have to wait until it cools down and the ""green light"" pops back on. I have never had this issue with my previous device by a brand name in the entirety of its use. Not sure why this product overheats.Wouldn't recommend for anyone who has more than a couple items to shred at a given time, it would just take all day between waiting out ""cooling"" times with this device. If you don't have the volume perhaps a tabletop shredder would be more convenient and less space consuming.

  We purchased this to replace an overpriced name brand shredder that finally gave out (after only 2 years with minimal shredding).  So far so good.  The sheet count is accurate, and I've shredded a few credit cards with the chip with no issue.  The one time I did overload it a bit, it was easy to reverse and pull it right out.  I also like that the catch container just pulls right out and easily fits with a trash bag in it.  Our old one required that we disassemble the shredder and had weird sharp edges that always punctured the bag and left paper shreds everywhere.  This one is easy, just pull out, swap bags and push back in.  Done.  It's also the quietest paper shredder I've ever used.  Highly recommended, especially for the price.

  Have been looking forward to getting this for a while....not going to lie. Ya, I know what your thinking. What lame-o is looking forward to buying a paper shredder. This guy right here!Well, I just moved and wanted to get rid of a lot of old files that have been piling up. Even though the shredder is smaller than I expected, it is working like a dream. It chomped down everything I threw into it's bottomless shredder mouth. I am awaiting a second stock pile of file to throw at it again. Stay tuned or not!Ps. You may need to empty multiple times if going through a lot of paper. Patience is key you complaining-whining-nancies.

  Privacy, I'm sure, is important to you. Otherwise you wouldn't be looking at this product right now. And I'll tell you, this paper shredder does a good job. I like the cross shredding action because it makes me feel a bit more secure knowing that my information is in even more pieces. Unfortunately, I have a bad habit of piling up papers to shred and then doing them all at once. This paper shredder does not agree with this lifestyle. Not at all. I can only load a few sheets thick otherwise it refuses to go on. If I want to shred for a while it overheats fairly quickly and then I have to wait hours for it to calm down enough to continue. Also, and I'm not sure that this is my fault, one of the paper detectors gave out. That is, there are sensors that, when paper is inserted, detect the paper and tell the shredder to pull the paper in and shred. And one of mine died. So now, in order for the paper to be drawn in, I need to make sure I load the paper by the one working sensor. I'm giving this machine 4 stars because it should be good enough for someone who does a piece or two of paper every now and then. But if you're like me and are asking it to accomplish tasks bigger than it is willing, you're going to have issues

  Well...time to say goodbye to my old Guardian Shredder which by the way still works quite well! Still shreds about 30 sheets till you have to let it cool down. As the photo attests, it was literally a table-top shredder, albeit certainly would not hold those 30 cross-cut sheets at a time...anything over 10 and it would clog-up...This Amazon Basics shredder is like day-night different! This thing will shred an army of paper...so then I went after some old credit cards...no problem until I got to my Chase-Amazon-Visa...yes, I discovered all cards are not made the same...the shredder chews up the PLASTIC cards with ease...dude...I wish someone had told me these newer cards are METAL...yep...I thought I had destroyed my bran-new shredder, thank goodness for reverse! The short story, the shredder is just fine, the card not so much! The irony is quite humorous, my Amazon Visa card almost destroyed my Amazon Basics shredder! You just can't make this stuff up!I have become a fan of Amazon Basics products over the past few years and will continue, thanks Amazon!

  We needed a larger shredder and wanted one that shreds into small pieces. On some shredders you can shred personal documents and stir through the shreddings and find complete, uncut information, such as maybe your social security number.We are happy with this one. It's quieter than our old one, though it might be a tiny bit slower. That's okay because it does many more pages at a time than the old one, so it still gets the job done faster.With this one and other shredders that I have used it's important to insert the paper so the information goes in perpendicular to the direction of the feed. If for example, you have a letter printed on the paper in portrait format, be sure to insert the page vertically (in portrait orientation) into the shredder so the lines of text are cut into smaller pieces. The vertical cuts are longer than the horizontal cuts and therefore more information might be viewable if you insert into the shredder in landscape orientation a page printed in portrait orientation.

  I just got rid of a commercial shredder (long story) and could have kicked myself. I was worried that I would not be able to find anything comparable. This little shredder for the price has shocked me! I kinda am glad I don't have the big hyge shredder anymore! This is the perfect size for what I know need and I have tested it a little more than I probably should and it has come through great!!! I am happy that I got this one after looking several months and comparing. I did purchase the oil as well and use it the 1st of every month or 2 times a month depending on how much I actually shred. I love that it is a cross cutting as I live in an apartment and they caught someone going through our trash!! I don't have to worry because it does such a great job shredding!! Someone would have to have an unbelievable amount of time to try to piece together anything!!!

  I ordered the AmazonBasics 15-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper, CD Credit Card Office Shredder. It's quite a bit larger/taller than I was expecting; guess I didn't pay attention to the dimensions given in the description. It's a good size for a small office, maybe a bit much for the typical home office. Overall, though, we love it-- it's pretty solid, has the features we wanted (a pull out bin, window to monitor volume of shred bits in bin, shreds credit cards and CDs/DVDs) plus it is MUCH quieter than our previous shredded, a smaller AmazonBasics shredder that lasted a few years. The only thing we're not happy with is the power/function switch itself; it feels cheap and lightweight,  and has a lot of ""play"" as you're switching it between functions (on, off, reverse, auto). Our old AB shredder's switch/button was a LOT more solid. We suspect the one on this new model will give out before the shredder itself does. If Amazon would redesign and make a more solid on/off/function button, they'd have a pretty darn  near perfect shredder in this model.

  I was very excited by this purchase (that's on me, I suppose). Seems like a nice item but it jammed 5 minutes into first use, with no more than 4 pages going at a time. There's now a compacted ball of paper stuck above the teeth.NBD, you'd think. Just pull it out. Friends, it's STUCK. There's a protective lip above the teeth mechanism and getting tools in there is no small feat. I've used, no joke: needle nose pliers, multiple tiny precision screwdrivers, an angled flat wrench that came with flat pack furniture, pens, two knives, a sheet of Amazon shredder sharpener/lubricant, and now I'm up to FIRE. I bought a creme brulee torch when the fireplace Bic didn't get there. Oh sure, SOMETHING is smoking but it's not the wad of paper.The shredder works, yes. It now pulls all paper around the clog, leading to more jamming risk. But it also stopped functioning as intended almost immediately, without negligence on my part. Returning it isn't worth the hassle, and what I assumed would be an easy fix left the unit scratched up. And that's before I tried fire.Seriously. I shouldn't have to use fire.

  PRO TIP/SAVE MONEY: all shredders need their blades to be lubricated for optimal functioning and long life. Wanna save some dough? Don't buy ""special"" lubricating oils/sheets. Few drops of VEGETABLE OIL will do as good of a job as those ""lubricating oils"".Don't believe me? Check out the manual of this shredder...Now to the review: I needed shredder for casual use. This one is compact, comes with attached basket, and clamis to be able to shred up to 6 sheets at the time.So far, it does it's purpose. However, claim of 6 sheets at the time seems bit exaggerated.I've shred 6 pieces of copy paper at the time, and the shredder seemed to struggle. It did its job, but for a moment, I was afraid it might jam. In addition, motor got quite warm.The good:- price.-credit card shredding option-cross cut for better security.The bad:-small- must be used with supplied basket.- 6 pages at once might be exaggeration.- long cool time - I believe it is 30 minutes.Summary:If you need compact shredder for casual use, it might be the right fit for you. I would not recommend shredding 6 pages at once at all times, it will overheat and motor might burn out. Better to be safe than sorry and do 2-3 pages at the time.

  Recently bought this and immediately fed an inch-thick pile of printer paper through it.  Over several hours of course.My impression is that it is exactly what it claims to be - a six-sheet shredder.  My only comment is that it seems to struggle at 6 sheets, especially of they wad up a bit when feeding (as they often do).  But, thanks in part to my patience, there was never any hint of overheating.  I had to  empty the tiny wastebasket a few times (tapping it helps the bits to settle) but that's to be expected.  So overall, if you need a shredder that handles a few pages a few times a day, this is the one for you.  You certainly can't beat the price.

  I recently moved into a new second home and needed a new shredder. I purchased an Amazon Basics 15 sheet shredder 3 years ago and have been very happy with it. I saw this 18 sheet shredder, about the same price and thought it would be just what I needed with even larger capacity. I was wrong. This shredder is not near as sturdy as my other one and I have had issues with paper jams even though it claims 18 sheets. It works fine if I shred around 10 sheets or less. I thought I was getting more capacity but not so. It also seems quite a bit louder than my other shredder. Bottom line, the shredder doesn’t do what it claims, at least for me.

  Stopped to write this review because I’m getting ready to take the shredder apart for the 6th time. Constantly gets bounded up. It clams it can handle 6 sheets of paper. 2 sheets boggs it down so much I end up becoming a cheerleader giving it support & telling it u can do this. 3 sheets of paper ur pushing it & plan on taking it apart & cleaning the teeth or like what I just did forget to dump it & when it gets totally full guess what??....... it’s bogged up again.

  Guys; I really like this little bugger...it's small but seems pretty powerful for my needs (I will not be shredding War and Peace, so using it to do an occasional credit card, some bills or personal papers are fine). The spec says it can shred up to 8 sheets, which isn't necessary for me....I did 4 and it was no problem...It also can handle one ply cardboard (the kind that undershirts are packed with) and can cut through an ordinary staple or two. It's smaller than what I imagined (and lighter), but that's fine. The top which houses the motor seems very sturdy and feels like it can handle the occasional heavier workload if needed. I will update after I use further, but I'm quite happy with it based on price and size.

  With all of the ""important papers"" I call them,that I simply cannot throw away because of sensitive information, it was time to invest some money in a shredder so I could get rid of all of this paper.Believe me when I say this was not an impulse buy but something I spent a few days researching. I looked at all types of shredders in all different price ranges. I was going to go with other brands that were a bit ""well known""$100+ was a bit high for me but others offered less features for higher $100. I found this shredder, went through reviews and decided to take my chance. I'm glad I did!This shredder has never over heated on me. It has shredded all paper seamlessly as long as you dont go above the 15 page limit. The only downfall I see is that once you turn it on, it's on, in contstant motion even when you are not shredding but if that's the worst thing I'm okay with it. There is a light indicator if your bin is full. You can get away with adding more if you shake the bin a bit and close it. It is a good sized shredder, with wheels! So you can wheel it from room to room as needed.Overall this is a great shredder in my eyes.

  Great little shredder. I wanted something smaller than normal, yet effective, and this fit the bill. I bought this shredder in July 2015 when I decided to convert all my documents to digital. I've shredded a few thousand pages of documents, and its still going strong. In fact, I used it today. I like that it shred credit/debit cards too.It's not perfect by any means: I've jammed it three times--it stopped completely--by feeding it more sheets than suggested.The first time I thought it was broken, but with a lot of patience (about 30 minutes; faster the other times) we were able to dig out the bits that were causing the problem. My suggestion would be to shred five or less sheets. It would be nice if it cross cut the paper, but someone would have to be really patient to try to piece together useful personal details from a big pile of shredded paper, so now worries there.

  This shredder worked perfectly fine for about a year. We used it light-moderately, shredding some mail here and there and some papers from college now and again. It had no problem shredding cards and taking paperclips, but then I went to shred something, just one sheet thick, it jammed up and just never worked again. It wouldn't even turn on. We tried to fix it, but nothing worked.It works as a shredder, which isn't really that hard to do, but it seems like it would have been worth the extra 10-20 bucks to just get a better one off the bat if it's just going to break in a year. I would say just shell out the extra 20 bucks and get a better quality one if you want to actually keep using it.

  This is an awesome shredder!  I think it's even better than the commercial shredders that I used when I was working for the government.  I have been shredding for four days and there has not been one jam.  I loaded the big recycling truck yesterday with huge garbage bags full of shredded paper. No overheating.  A red light comes on when the adequately sized bin is full. The noise is moderate. I did shred one CD just to try it.  Since the shredded CD can't be recycled with the paper I probably won't use that feature much.  Paperclips...I tried to remove them before shredding but I think one went through fine.  No problem at all with staples.  I did not count the number of sheets that I passed through the machine at one time.  I was reasonable.

  We have a small home so we wanted a VERY small shredder and we're also on a budget. So many of the other shredders are crazy expensive. We took a shot at this cheaper one from Amazon and we really like it. It's incredibly small - comes up to my knee - and isn't very wide, yet we can shred a LOT of paper and still have room in the container. It is pretty loud when it shreds and can only take up to about 4 pieces of paper at a time. It takes so much longer and more effort to shred envelopes so we have to take the paper out of the envelope before shredding and do them separately each time. It has the options ""auto"" ""off"" or ""reverse"". The top you just pull off - it's not very secure so if we run into the shredder, the whole thing spills out. However, its size and quality is perfect for us because ultimately it does shred.

  I didn't expect too much from this paper shredder for what it costs. As the name implies, it's pretty basic. That, however, doesn't mean it's bad, because it still does what it's supposed to do and is pretty affordable compared to other paper shredders. It's very easy to set up and use as soon as you open it, and it does a great job shredding what you put into it. One thing to note is that it can be a bit loud, but not too loud compared to other shredders out there. Another thing is that sometimes when I am using it, the shredding will stop all of a sudden, which is probably due to what I'm shredding may be too thick to pass through the shredder. If that's the case, it can be unpredictable, because the shredder would sometimes stop when I shred something that's not as thick as something I have previously shredded. This happens rarely though, so it's not a big inconvenience. Overall, I knew what to expect when I purchased this and it only gets used maybe once or twice a week. For those who will probably use a shredder more often, consider a more high end shredder.

  I'm loving this shredder!!! We've all had those shredders that say ""7 sheets"" but strain to do 4. This one says 15 and I've easily done 12. Other reviews have said it's loud but I don't find that to be the case. I haven't had it overheat. The last one I had would overheat if I used it for more than a few minutes. I like the ""basket full"" light and that it shuts off until you empty the basket. The basket is a good size. It also takes care of credit cards very well.

  If you need to shred only a few pages every so often, this is fine. But you decide to go through your old stash of papers that you have been saving for one reason or another and weed out what you don't need, this does not work on that occasion especially with the 2 min run time and 30 min cool down. It's pretty small too.

  I like this shredder alot. It is fast, takes a good amount of paper and is quiet.My only complaint would be I can't put a shredder bag in the bin. Were ever the ""door open"" sensor is the bag is in it's way so it's showing that the door is open and won't allow the shredder to work. My old shredder I was able to put a bag into the bin and not worry when I was emptying it that the pieces would fly all over the place.Bin size is big. Just like my old shredder the ""Bin Full"" light/stopper would come on, I just had to open the bin, shake it around alittle and/or push the shreded sections down, put the bin back in and shred away.Update: I ran a full bin full and I was able to put the bag over the bin and just flip it over and everything stayed in. Yes the Bin pulls out. It's not a door that you open and pull a bin out. The whole thing pulls out. The bin is basicly a ""trash can"" in a way.So far I'm very happy with this shredder, next day delivery, fast, quite, good priced and a warrenty..

  The specs state this product can do 6 sheets and at an extremely basic level, yes it can do 6 sheets, but it sounds like it's going to have a stroke doing so.  You can get away with 6 once every 10-15 minutes.  Do more than 2x6 runs in a row and the thing overheats and has to stop for 5 minutes.  Don't even think about feeding it a typical credit card junk mail envelope, stops about 2 seconds into it and has to cool down, or worse, you have to reverse it out, wait for the cool down, then open up the envelope and feed it one sheet at a time.Maybe my expectations were just too high, but from the description I expected to be able to feed it for at least a few minutes before I had to deal with a cool down, but it's literally 1-2 minutes and it stops.  If you have even 1 days worth of junk mail or paper to shred, it will take multiple passes to get it all done.Unless you have extremely basic shredding needs and get a minute amount of junk mail or snail mail, pay the few dollars extra and get a more resilient version of this product.

  I really like this shredder. It easily shredded 8-9 sheets of paper and credit cards. It's quite noisy, though. My dog doesn't like it. I'm moving and purchased it to get rid of excess paper. I generated FOUR 30 gallon bags of shredded paper (which will make for great packing material), so, if you're going to shred 10 years of documents like I did, it WILL eventually overheat but only after about 6 or so consecutive buckets full. I was basically sitting on the floor, feeding it endless documents when it finally went ""nope!"". I let it rest for about an hour and then it was fine. But it's a powerful little machine. One drawback is when you empty it, there's usually paper stuck in the shredding grill and you get paper everywhere.  But for everyday use and home office use, I highly recommend this. I'm definitely glad I bought it, so now I can shred as I go along and not have a mountain of paper in my desk drawer.

  It is very small and does not hold very much at all. I also cannot stand the silver  thing at the top that I guess is there as a safety mechanism but it is so poorly designed that it is difficult to get paper in Easley to shred. You can't put it straight down. Do you have to angle the papers into the machine. Very bad design.And, this thing only lasted 2 months Ford breaking down. I literally only used this five times in the last 2 months that I owned it. I only needed it to occasionally shred bills here and there. I was completely shocked when the shredder jammed last week after putting 4 sheets of paper in it at the same time. I tried whatever I could to get it unjammed. I figured I was out of luck in getting my money back for this since it's past the 30 day return policy but I saw someone mention on here that there's a 1 year warranty, so I will be contacting Amazon about this.

  I bought this to shred some extra personal documents I had around the house and it works great. After I opened the box I put it to the test. I did not test the 6 sheet limit, but I did run around 200 sheets through it within the first hour. I also shredded 3 credit cards. No issues and it shredded everything making it unreadable. This would be a great shredder for anyone looking for a personal shredder.

  My 15 year old shredder died on me and i needed to replace it. Of course the company didn't make that model any longer and other models did not get good reviews. I read reviews for couple of hours and started to get frustrated because every shredder had issues.  I saw this, read the reviews and was impressed. Purchased it and I must say it has impressed me thus far.  The packaging was great, double boxed, no indication of what was inside. The inside box was also very sturdy and impressively packaged. There is no assembly required - at all. The casters are already on, all you do is open the boxes, pull out, plus in and amazingly it works. The cuts are small about 1"" or less long (not micro) but for my use that's fine. The bin is very easy to open and close, the control panel is easily understood, the construction is nice (hard plastic), it has a small profile and would fit under a desk (It fits perfectly in a corner next to a file cabinet and printer). I think that at this price point, this shredder deserves 5 stars indeed.

  When my husband and I sold our business, our large shredder went with the new owners.  I bought this small shredder knowing it was not meant to do the heavy shredding the other one did.  That being said, I am definitely satisfied with the job it does.  It is much faster than I thought it would be, and it shreds plastic credit cards with no problem at all.  I imagined I would have to stop a shredding project every few minutes for the shredder to cool down, but that has not been the case. Although not for heavy, continuous use, this is a very sturdy, small shredder, which is certainly great for home use and would work for most small offices having a minimal amount of shredding.

  The shredder died after minimal usage, totally dead.  A number of reviews seem to be happy with the unit, but I read other reviews with similar issues and consequently I would think twice before purchasing another one.  I had a shredder that lasted 10 years, but as they say they just don't make'em like they used to.  My suspicions are that there is poor quality control in the manufacturing process -  get what you pay for.Also,  the shredder unit fits snugly into the trash container.  Seems like a good idea, except that is somewhat of a hassle to remove the thing and empty the trash can.  My previous shredder had adjustable arms that would allow it to fit on top of a trash can , so you could use it with the size of container of your choice  -  This is not a big deal,  I'm just saying it was more convenient to me.Finally, I will say that the unit did a good job of shredding while it lasted.  Although it did seem to heat up fairly quickly.  Spec says it can run for 3 minutes of continuous use, which I never came close to while the thing was working.  Occasionally I have spent quite a bit of time shredding old documents for about 30 - 45 minutes with my old shredder ... never had a problem !Anyway,  I would give this a 2 star rating only because a large number of reviews seem to okay with it.  Chances are you will get one that works for awhile, but eventually will just die - I am going to look for a higher quality unit my self.

  Clearly the quietest shredder I’ve ever encountered!  It’s well built, reliable and extremely quiet.  The controls are easy to read and the lights help.  It’s not a commercial shredder so I did buy the extended warranty.  I went through a stack of mail with it already.  No issues at all.  I do open the envelopes first as three sheets folded in an envelope is essentially the same as 11 sheets. This shredder is fast and very quiet. A great value and very  highly recommended.

  I had to leave behind this shredder when I moved across the country because I didn't have the space to bring it with me. Thought I could manage without one but quickly found that I hated simply cutting up mail and other sensitive documents by hand because it didn't feel safe enough. Re-purchased this same shredder because it had done such a great job during the last three years that I owned it. It's not great for heavy-duty shredding i.e. more than six pages at a time. But it does go on for a while without getting overheated. Purchasing some lubricating sheets helps a lot for its longevity. Alternatively, I've used regular cooking oil to lubricate the blades and it works just as well, its only downside is that it's a bit messier than simply putting a lubricated sheet through it.

  I bought this shredder because I needed one that shredded more than 3 sheets of paper and didn't quit for a cooling down period after five minutes and this one is definitely better and quieter. It is around 20 pounds but is on casters so it can be rolled to wherever you want to place it. I love this shredder.It shreds 10-14 sheets of paper without a problem and it states that it can continuously shred for up to 20 minutes but the longest I've done it continuously is 15 minutes for about 300 +/- sheets. It is quiet and there is a feature that stops the shredder when the paper reaches the top of the bin, which is a great feature so the paper doesn't get stuck in the shredding wheels and jam. It also has other features but I haven't encountered them yet.I would recommend this shredder for those who want something that shreds with no hassles and for a longer period of time.

  Works pretty much as advertised. Works great for 1-4 sheets, more than that and you can tell it's starting to work hard. The 4 stars are because I would really only say this was a 6 sheet machine. Since I prefer not to push the limits and hear the machine grunting to accomplish the task. Having said that, it will do 8 sheets and as long as you did not do that repeatedly it will handle it.  If you have a mountain of paper on a regular basis, you should consider a larger capacity machine.I had a large amount of paper stored waiting to get a shredder, so the first day it arrived I ran it off/on for a couple hours. Emptying the bin several times.  Handled it well and never overheated. Again, do not expect this machine to handle non-stop 8 sheets for long periods of time.  But for normal use it's a good value to price.You can easily see the paper building up as you shred, easy to empty. Safety features are reasonable and you must have the shredder firmly pushed into the bin. If you empty bin and replace it and it does not work, make sure the bin is empty and that the shredder is fully in contact with the bin. Even a slight gap will cause it to not work.

  Purchased this for household shredding. Nothing too extreme. Just some old files. At first I loved the shredder, it seemed to work best with 2 pages max or it would over heat quickly. Once it over heats it takes a long time to allow shredding again. That wasn't my issue however. While shredding I heard a loud pop, and when I opened the top I noticed that a black piece of plastic that is in between the blades had broken off. I removed it, and noticed there was and other plastic band under the black piece that had broken off and jammed into the blades. I have submitted a return.

  One of the worst shredders I have ever had. I had to get a replacement for the shredder once a year for the last 3 years. I only use it for light use, and not heavy use. Don't buy this one,  get a better one. Amazon didn't want to even replace it the first time, even after the first one crapped out after 3 months. The warranty is for a year. Don't waste your time with this product. Seriously, buy something that actually works. I know you're thinking it's a bad review don't listen to it, but seriously don't do it, don't buy it.

  I haven’t been able to use it but I’ll update the review when I get the replacement. One corner of the outer box was pushed in but the inner box looked fine. When I opened it I found the plastic case around the top badly cracked. Other than that the shredder looks nice and required little setup other than removing the tape holding the bin in place for shipping and plugging the unit in.Update 1/2/18We got the replacement delivered today and it’s not damaged. The shredder is much quieter than the one it replaced. I haven’t done a sheet count test but it doesn’t seem to have a problem with moderately thick envelopes of junk mail. It does take a second or so to start shredding and runs a bit slow but it does a fine job and I’m usually not in a real rush to shred anything. Overall it does what I expected and at a fair price.

  First one was dirty and obviously sent back by someone else. The replacement lasted less than one year, and was used 6 times, approx. 2 cans full of shredder paper. That's it. Works great and then doesn't, very quickly.  I usually purchase protection plans on everything but there wasn't one for this price range. What a waste. It works in reverse, but not forward.

  So first I'll tell you that Amazon replaced 12-sheet New Shredder #1 with 12-sheet New Shredder #2.  So far #2 appears better, but it hasn't had the workout #1 had.  I was kinda' hoping Amazon would offer the micro-cut shredder to apologize, but they didn't.I had a good-sized stack of shred fodder waiting excitedly for New Shredder (#1), and New Shredder plowed through the pile.  Quiet, powerful, a little tight on the intake slot, but hey.  Except it didn't shred too well.A certain well-known financial company prints their statements landscape (indeed, many do, I would guess).  That can be a problem for a strip shredder, but that's why you buy cross-cut, right?  If New Shredder had produced output of the length advertised, the chances of useful data coming out the bottom would be slim.  But it didn't.  I started noticing 6, 8, even 10-inch strips coming out the bottom, some clearly reading ""YOUR NAME ACCOUNT NUMBER SUCH-AND-SUCH TYPE OF ACCOUNT"", and stuff like that.  You know, stuff that's supposed to get shredded.Amazon claimed it was defective unit and I had a replacement in a day with UPS picking up and hauling off the old one the same day at no cost.  So Amazon made good.  But I'm a little leery of the 'defective unit' theory and am watching carefully to determine if there's a design issue.So far New Shredder #2 seems, um, better, but then, as I noted, it hasn't had a big workout yet (New Shredder #1 ate though poorly digested all the goodies) and I've started tearing landscape-printed statements in half to feed the type in so any strips that escape won't tell a story, which is probably good advice for anyone.

  I received this, but to be honest, why would they make the receiver for shredded paper so short.  It is plastic, come on  make it 6-9 inches taller so we can shred without leaning over so much.  The receiver is the cheapest thing to manufacturer and mold and they skimped.  I do not care if this lasts 10 years, my office max that lasted 8 years and it had a metal mesh bin and was 6 inches taller for a cheaper price.  This is poorly thought out for use, I do not expect much form this.

  I was impressed by how well the actual paper shredder itself worked, but the bucket leaves a LOT to be desired.  It has no handle, so you have to lift the shredder up and set it down somewhere, getting little pieces of paper everywhere in order to empty this unit.  It also feels cheap.  I don't feel safe leaving this shredder plugged in when not in use, and having to unplug it all the time is an extra inconvenience.  Also, the shredder blades are positioned in such a way that the paper shreds create a vertical tower when it falls into the basket.  This makes it look like the basket is full when it's really not.  So I have to take the shredder off and push the shredded paper down in the bin so I can continue.  I suppose I could just shake the bucket with the shredder attached but I don't feel safe doing that.Thankfully I just got this for my garage so it's not the end of the world.  I'm thinking about buying the 8-sheet unit with the pull-out bin since the shredder itself shreds so well.  I have another shredder I bought from a reputable big name company for $175 a few years back that I use as my main shredder, and I think this $40 Amazon shredder actually shreds paper better.  My old one isn't dull as it shreds the same as it always has.  I just think the motor on this one is better.In conclusion, if you're looking for a cheap shredder, this one is pretty good for the money.  If you want a more convenient shredder, I'd recommend one with a pull-out tray.  It's almost twice as much money though ($75 vs. $40).  Worth it to me but if you're a small business on a tight budget then this one's fine so long as you're willing to live with the inconveniences.

  I have bought 3 shredders over the past several years and this one is by the far the best. Before, I have bought the $50 shredders at Office Depot or Walmart. They last a while, but you have to be really careful not to load too much paper in to them or they get clogged up and it takes a lot of effort to unclog them. This time, I decided to spend more and see if the quality improves. This machine is way more powerful, takes more paper at a time, has a larger holding bin, and has not gotten clogged up even once. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now. So far, so good. I'm glad I spent the extra money to get a much higher quality machine.

  It's an okay experience. I mean when you think about it, a paper shredder seems like an easy enough tool that it shouldn't have to be electric but here we are.It's definitely shredding papers, one by one it seems. You can't load a significant amount of depth to the stack of papers your shredding so you end up with like jams all the time because who wants to be at their knees shredding papers on this tiny waste basket.It works trust me, but it's not going to be time saving or convenient.

  This shredder does the job nicely and quietly. The shedding motor is definitely heavy duty, as weighs about twice as much as my old 8 Sheet shredder. It also cuts the sheets up a lot smaller than my old shredder did. It would be nice if the trash can was bigger but other than that this things is the bomb and the price was right, at less than $60.00.The only negative I can come up with so far is, you're supposed to empty it when the paper is to the top of the window and it's kinda hard to tell when that is. Before I emptied it for the first time it got too full and it was a chore cleaning the shredded paper out of the cutters, they are freakin' sharp! With the help of a pair of needle scissor like teezers and the reverse function, I was able to get the mess cleared. Now I will empty it more often!

  This is okay if you only need to shred bills or the random document. But they are not kidding about 6 sheets. The machine will jam if you put more sheets or use thicker paper. It's also worth remembering That folding paper effectively increases the amount that is being shed. So this rarely can chew through unopened mail. Also, if you shred several documents in sequences, the machine will overheat and shut itself off. Finally, it does fill up pretty quick.In short, the low cost and small size make it okay for occasional home use. However, if you run a small business or otherwise shred lots of documents, this will not meet your needs.

  I am about to begin disposing of old business records -- volume is large, and it will really put the machine to the test. So far, I am really impressed - the price is roughly half the price of similar capacity shredders; so far no jams or poorly shredded documents (some of which are damp from basement storage. Eats small staples without obvious complaint, ditto for a credit card. Haven't tried digital optical discs yet. I hope I'll finish the job within the warranty period. BTW - the manual says it will run continuously for 20 minutes, then needs 45 minutes to recover. Both numbers are pretty impressive for this price tier.

  I havent had a paper shredder since forever ago..An advertisement impressed me, stating all of a shredders features It was purported to shred just about anything. I purchased it.  Within no time, possibly three months, it conked out on me and repairing it was not an option. I was done spending my hard earned money on  paper shredding.Recently I came across an advertisement on Amazon about an inexpensive paper shredder. The price was so reasonable and the ad explained the features that I became interested. I took a chance and ordered it.I am so happy I purchased it. It is not anything fancy, but it is perfect for the needs of my household. The price was great, and I believe that its simplicity will just about guarantee a long life in my home.Thank you Amazon for pricing your products affordable. Everyone needs this shredder!

  AFTER USING 2 OTHERS AT FRIENDS HOUSES I CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DRAW BACKS TO THIS ONE. THE SLOT IS EXACT WHICH MEANS THE SHEETS OF PAPER HAVE TO LINE UP ALMOST EXACTLY TO THE SLOT. THERE IS NO SMALL OPEN SLOT WHEREBY SHOULD YOU WANT TO DISCARD A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE SHREDDER FEATURE. THEY MAKE THE SHIELD ON TOP DOUBLE AS A HANDLE. IT HAS NO CLEAR FRONT WINDOW TO OBSERVE WHEN IT IS FILLING UP OR GETTING CLOSE TO THE TOP. ONE UNIT I USED HAS NO FRONT OR BACK TO THE CONTAINER SO WHEN YOU GO TO PLACE THE SHRED TOP BACK ON, IT DOESNT MATTER WHICH WAY YOU PLACED THE CONTAINER BACK DOWN. THIS UNIT ONLY GOES BACK ON IN ONE DIRECTION. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ONE AGAIN! IM THINKING OF GIVING IT AWAY AND BUY ANOTHER CHOICE WITH MORE RESEARCH RATHER THAN PRICE. THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

  I don't frequently shred, so my pile of papers tends to build up. My old shredder (still works, but only 5 pages at a time and nothing other than paper) overheated in a longer shred session. I turned to Amazon and found a compromise in price and features with this shredder.Pros:- Allows for up to 15 pages- Larger bin means less dumping- Mixed media capabilities (can finally shred those old credit cards and insurance cards)- Super quietNeither pro nor con:- It keeps feeding for a few seconds after the media is shredded through. I assume this is to ensure all media is cleared of the feed and the teeth.Concern, not con:The autofeed works via sensor, instead of a physical switch. It's not in the middle of the feed (offset to the right), so if you're a little off it won't actuate. Once you're aware of this, and the sensor location, it's not a big deal.Overall a satisfied purchase and my minor concern is easily manageable.

  Just got this so no report on durability.  However, I did shred a 5"" stack that had been building up.  Tested 8 pages and went through smoothly.  If you don't get the pages in straight, machine will bind up a bit but that is user error.  Made quick work of my pile and I had to dump twice.  Easy to lift off lid and dump contents.  Really like the front peek hole that allows you to see how full the basket is.  Wish I would have bought this years ago to replace the small, slow unit I had.

  A really good shredder for light home use.  The shredder itself weighs about four or five pounds I would guess. The attached waste basket was not designed to hold this much weight or any weight. It split just from the weight and vibrations when using shredder. Luckily I have a lot of duct tape (looks kind of tacky though).

  So far so good! Runs a little slow whether single sheet or multiples but chews up everything I feed it and has not jammed once.This includes junk solicitations I don't even have to take out of envelope. Clear window on front is very helpful as is the red ""full"" warning lamp.At 21"" tall, size may be an issue for some but we have plenty of room under the desk and it rolls in and out very easily. I don't expect this will break down as have some other less robust shredders we've owned. Happy Camper!

  Great. I'm not fond of its ""I start when you feed me paper"" -- I'd rather it just STAY ON so I'm not scrambling to get the next sheets in WHILE it's running, rather than"" it stops, I feed, it takes a sec to start...""  if I don't get the next page in, ""it stops, I feed, it takes a sec to start."" {sigh}  I THOUGHT I bought on with an actual ""on"" button (one that runs till I shut it off).  Oh well, in a couple years, when this dies, I look closer at the description before buying my next one.  Small complaint, specific to me.It DOES shred really beautifully; I don't need the high-level security shredding; this does find. (Makes good mulch too -- if you only do good paper, and cover it with ... less-noticeable ... mulch. Pine straw or whatever.)

  I have used this in several long shredding sessions (with some brief pauses as I gather up things) and have yet to have it overheat.  My old shredder would overheat after running for 5 minutes, so I have a lot in my need to shred piles. In each session I have filled the bin to capacity, and found it's very easy to remove and put back in place.  I've used shredders that can be finicky about placement and have not had that problem with this one.

  This is my second try with this shredder, and, because the first died quickly, this time I purchased a Square Trade 4-year warranty. Today is 21 months and five uses later, and, again, it has died. I have been very conscientious about never feeding more than just three regular sheets through. It has always been very sluggish and slow, so there will be no third try. This gets very little personal use so is a huge disappointment. FYI: DON'T BUY SQUARE TRADE WARRANTY!!!!! Web site for claims does not work. Phoned them and they wanted a receipt for item, even though tied to Amazon. After three hours of back-and-forth, Amazon just refunded the purchase price. Am filing complaint with BBB. On the other hand, ASURION WARRANTIES are FABULOUS.

  This does handle unopened stuffed envelopes and it produces very little dust.  The particles are small enough to defy reconstruction of an address or other personal information.  It is well worth the money.  Some brands we have only been able to use outside while wearing a mask because of the amount of dust and particles.  The AmazonBasics 15 sheet Cross Cut is an excellent product that has not overheated or jammed while filling 3 leaf bags full of shredded paper.  We did stop to empty the basket but otherwise it was non stop and several hours of work.

  I don't often write reviews anymore, however, I'm baffled by the 5 star reviews. I can only assume they are written by people who use this shredder occasionally, for a couple sheets of paper at a time.I've owned this shredder for over a year, and I'm about to toss it. I am not usually a heavy shredder. It was completely fine for shredding the occasional document or two, which was all I had been doing.First of all, the ""8 page"" capacity is not accurate. It's more like if you have 4 pages, double sided. And sometimes, it struggles with that.Also, a few months into owning the shredder, the safety sensor that tells the shredder to turn off about 10 seconds after a paper has been fed through, broke. Not a huge deal. Instead of leaving the shredder on ""auto"", I had to turn it off and on manually.At the end of the year last year, I decided to purge a bunch of old documents. Here's where the safety sensor really seems to be needed. By continually running, the unit overheats quickly. Then you have to wait 20 minutes. Which is a complete pain if you have a lot of shredding to get through.I've just finished a major purge, and while I probably *should* have taken my stuff somewhere to be shredded, I decided to do it with this machine. It took 3 days, but I got through 4 boxes of shredding. And this thing is about done. The plastic guides between the teeth are breaking, and paper gets caught in the corners of the grinder. Which also decreases operation time, as it puts pressure on the motor, which then overheats.And yes, I was oiling the heck out of the shredding blades.In short, I won't buy this one for my new place. I'm going to look for something a little more heavy duty. Because I tend not to keep up with the daily shredding, and end up doing a lot at one time. Which is way more than this little unit can handle.On the plus side, it is small, and it is easy to move around. And, when the insides were all intact, it was quiet. It also shredded credit cards handily, which is nice. Before the guide teeth broke, it made pretty good cross cut confetti. Fairly larger strips, but still cross cut. Now that it's broken, the edges of the paper tends to come out as one strip, while the center is confetti.

  I like the way the shredder operates as it does not cut the paper into strips, but shreds the paper into hundreds of small snippets which would be almost impossible to reassemble.  For that reason, I am very happy with the purchase.  However, I am not so pleased with the fact that the shredder should be left in an ""off"" position when not in use.  Although there is a pilot light that indicates the ""on"" position, I am finding that to be somewhat annoying since my old shredder was always in a ready mode.  However, I will probably grow accustomed to having to use the switch.  Bottom line?  It does a great job shredding paper and I certainly recommend it to anyone desiring a shredder that renders a document unreadable.  TMc

  Would recommend this product for anyone doing composting that gets a lot of junk mail.  It seems like our worm bin and compost were perpetually a bit too stinky, swampy, and plagued with fruit flies because we were good about throwing the ""green"" kitchen scraps in, but not very disciplined about balancing it with a commensurate amount of ""brown"" paper type of material to cover.  This shredder solved that problem.The credit card shredder feature was pretty useless since most of the cards we are issued have metal in them and cannot be shredded.It helped to have a tiny pair of needle nose pliers on hand because we're likely to jam more into the maw of the shredder than it could reasonably expect it to handle, especially irregularly shaped stuff like folded up grocery sales circulars, plastic-ish glossy realtor fliers, ugh- did that unopened alumni giving request have a bumper sticker in it?, you get the idea.  Compost purists would probably say I shouldn't have been putting these materials in to begin with, but I say Perfection is the enemy of the good.  Possibly related to our proclivity toward overstuffing-- after a year or so of light use, the shredder blades started turning at the point where it was switched on, not at the point where paper was inserted.  Not super safe with toddler fingers, but there are far more dangerous items in our house and we keep it unplugged with child-resistant outlet covers, so I wouldn't say this isn't a deal-breaking defect.I would also note that if you let it get substantially full between empties, shredded material sort of ""jack in the boxes"" out with the top removed, so we took to storing it in a larger cardboard box to keep the clean up to a minimum.  The overheat detection seemed to be in working order!

  2 units dead in under 6 months of very light usage. This seemed like a great shredder upon first use, but after a few months of extremely light use (hadn't even filled up the bucket once) it got jammed on only 4 sheets of paper, or it may have just died. Hard to tell if being jammed caused the motor to burn out, or if the machine jammed because the motor just died. Either way, no light, no power, no movement whatsoever. Amazon was great, and replaced no questions asked without even needing to send back. Was even more careful about only loading 2-3 pages at a time, and yet again within 6 months of extremely light usage (again before the bucket was filled, and being extra careful with minimal paper loading at one time) the unit died in the exact same way.It worked well enough when it worked, but seems to have a design flaw of some sort. First time amazon basics has disappointed.

  I was very pleased when I got this shredder. It is compact, even with its included garbage pail. It worked great at shredding. No problems.But when I went to use it today, after not having used it in a month and with no problems in any prior uses, it won't draw power. It's not the outlet; other things work in the outlet. And the shredder doesn't work in other outlets either. And the cord is permanently wed to the shredder, so it's not that either.It's just a bad shredder. Maybe not all of them. But definitely the one I got is a $40 paper weight. And when the goal is to get rid of paper, the last thing you need is another paperweight.Based on my experience, I do NOT recommend this purchase.

  This shredder handles what I would think is a common amount of household shredding. It feels a little flimsy compared to the very heavy old one I had that broke, but it does a good enough job for the price.It doesn't shred a lot of papers at one time, so if you need to shred any more than 8 sheets at a time (even less depending on the thickness of the paper), this is not going to work for you.It does, however, shred credit cards and, for me, the cross-cutting is a great feature to have and one that is not always offered on value-priced shredders. This shredder's pieces are a bit larger than what my old shredder produced, but they are still small enough to make me feel secure that no one will ever want to try and tape my documents back together.

  The shredder is not horrible for a standard shredder. It arrived with shreds in the cutter, showing it has been previously used. Another reviewer said amazon tested these before shipping them... maybe they should do that with the shameless defective magnetic eyelashes getting 1 star reviews all over the place! At first I thought my shredder had been used and resold and was ticked. Glad that's hopefully not the case.It's pretty heavy duty, but for Cons:1. It doesn't fit as many sheets as it says, I've only tried 3 at a time and even those go in wonky.2. You have to slide sheets in at a slant that's awkward and takes a little bit till you get the right angle for the machine to suck the stupid paper up.3. My shiz is NOT being cross cut. It's a standard spaghetti shredder, except it makes them a bit shorter... it doesn't hack your shiz into oblivion like super cautious peeps like me prefer.4. I've got about 8 boxes of crap to shred... this is gonna take forever! 🙈5. You're not gonna fit 8 sheets of standard paper in thru the wonky angle required to slide shiz in and have it actually decimate it all evenly... so a bit of false advertising there. I wish I could just slide papers in straight up and down. But no, you spend the majority of your shred time (which btw, can be highly therapeutic once you get into the zone... that old love letter from the jerk who cheated on you: GONE! That horrible picture from 6th grade of braces and acne: GONE!) just trying to get the single paper to fit into the right angle. Sigh. 😔6. Blades aren't very sharp. I expect them to dull fairly quickly. The cut isn't clean, but rather leaves floofy edges. Makes it harder for a thief to piece it back together, so I guess it's a win/win, but I think it's cuz the blades are dull.7. The boys at Amazon need to be sure they remove all the shreds before shipping these so they don't arrive a hot mess to deal with.Pros:1. The shiz is pretty well destroyed. Ain't nobody stealing your identity now! ✊🏽2. Haven't had an overheating issue yet.3. Please don't put fingers or hair into the shredder! 😂The instructions are priceless!4. It has a nice waste basket to catch everything, and they usually fit standard plastic grocery bags. Please recycle.5. It's fairly small... a bit top heavy to change the waste out... you'll get well acquainted with the thing tipping over and having to pic up all the little shred pieces off the floor when it was supposed to remain neatly in the basket... wait, that's more of a Con.And that's about it. It's a shredder. You need one. You don't want a cheap crap one, but don't wanna spend a ton on some state of the art shiz, which is why you are now here buying this one. If I had it to do over again, I might pick a different one that really cross-cuts things into oblivion. Can't someone invent a shredder that cross-cuts, grinds, and then incinerates the powdered reamains of what used to be your private life, before blasting the ashes into space? That would do the trick!Till then, this should work.You're welcome.

  I bought this shredder as a replacement of my other portable shredder that broke down after 7 years of having it.Even though I like the sensor that auto stops the shredder this machine stopped working After the 5th use. It did not show any signs of reheat, all I shredded were papers and only a few at a time. It worked perfectly the last time I used it but when I went to use it the 6th time it did not work, the power light did not turn on.

  This shredder is perfect for normal home use. I purchased the model that allows for 8 sheets at a time, but I rarely push it to that limit. My normal is 4 sheets at a time.  However, I did do 8 sheets just to test it, and it handled them perfectly.  I put this little guy to the test because I was consolidating 2 households into one, and found a file cabinet in the back of a closet with old check stubs and credit card payments. (Yep, those things used to exist in the pre-internet age!)  So, i had a couple evenings of hours of shredding time.  It kept up with me.It is a nice size to keep it by my desk in the corner of the living room. It doesn't take up much space. It is lightweight and easy to move.  I read some people stated they wish the bin was larger, but it suits my purposes.  I had to frequently empty it during my marathon shredding events, but otherwise, it is perfect for normal household use.It shredded credit cards with ease!The shredder is relatively quiet considering it is mechanical teeth eating away at some paper.  I also purchased some of the cleaning/lubricating sheets since I knew in the beginning I would be using it hard. They work great as well, and they will get a separate review.I highly recommend this shredder for normal household use.

  This is just a great buy. This unit will outdo any consumer level shredder I have ever used. Most of these are very limited in the number of pages it can do over a period of time. Some can't do more than a couple of pages without bogging down and many of these lesser shredders require frequent and lengthy cool down periods. This is a nice unit just don't get carried away and jam too much into it at once. If I had one complaint, I wish the holding bin was larger but that only matters when tackling large jobs. For the price its everyday use is just about perfect.

  Had Fellowes Powershred W-11C  ($61) lasted 2 yrHad Fellowes Powershred 79Ci ($179)  lasted 4 yr 2 mo.AmazonBasics 8-Sheet ($35) so far 2 yr 9 mo.So got this cheap one just to see how long it'll last. It's really for light use. This week we are cleaning basement and shredder has been overworked. I know the 3 min run 30 downtime, but still it overheated. Turned unit off and when turned it back on the motor runs but wouldn't take paper. I noticed there's a clump of shredded paper on the left side, reverse didn't help. But after using lubricant and poke around with my slim long tweezers I was able to get some paper out. It is now working.So far it has been a good buy, beats the $61 Fellowes model and you shouldn't have a problem shredding a few receipts, bills etc. It will take a while to shred years of statements.

  I have had at least 5 shredders.  This one really does the job.  The convenient handle makes removing the shredder head from the basket a snap unlike others that require 2 hands to lift the head.  It's fast.  I thought I needed a micro shredder, but I am happy with this cross-cut.  If you orient sensitive text perpendicular to the feed, it does a great job shredding the text such that someone would have to be really patient to put it back together again from the basket of shreds.

  Definitely a light-weight shredder. Don't let the paperwork pile up for too long or else you'll be struggling with the speed and capacity of this little unit. While it cross-cuts alright, the pieces seem a little bigger than what I've seen from other shredders — ok, but not great.Build quality is a little suspect. The on & reverse switch on this was pretty loose right out of the box; since the documentation states these are hand-tested by Amazon before they ship out, I wonder if the testers were a little too hard on mine.My biggest complaint is the lack of a real auto-shutoff when the basket gets full. It just keep accepting sheets until the shreds reach the very top. At that point, removing the cutter almost guarantees several shreds spilling out of the basket, making a mess.On the positive side, the shredder does cut pretty quickly and thoroughly. The reverse does the job whenever there's a rare jam. And it chops up cards and staples without problem.

  This paper shredder is much more safe than my last one, the shred teeth are protected from little fingers (my grand children like to shred for me and they push the paper vs feeding it in).  Literally cannot get your fingers into the teeth.  It shred a few extra seconds so all the paper is shredded, none left in the feeder discharge. Not any more quiet than my last, but it's not a bad level of noise. I can, and have shred 6 sheets without it suffering or bogging down, 8 sheets will slow down but still powers through ...much better than my last one!  This is for my personal use and I'm happy, plus the bin is larger, win-win! If I get 10 yrs out of it like my old one, I'll been super happy ;)

  Great shredder for the price. I was in the process of moving and faced with the task of destroying over ten years of medical & financial records. After filling over 8 thirty gallon trash bags the device is still working like new.I did find that the shredder struggled with more than three sheets and the battle increased, as expected, up to the maximum number of sheets. The device will shutdown if you exceed the runtime of the unit. You will also have to let it sit powered off for the required time if you do trip the thermal overload.The collection bin is quite small but I am judging it based on the volume of paper I was processing which is not a fair benchmark to the shredder because it is not listed as a bulk device.I would recommend this to anyone.

  It’s a solid shredder for the price. It gets a little slow with around 5 or more sheets, but it gets the job done!What I don’t like, though, is that when you lift it to move it, there aren’t any really obvious handled on the can. If you have arthritis or a weak grip, you might want to be careful moving it as the shredder simply rests on top of a plastic trash can.I recommend it! And boy is it fun to shred all kinds of mail and other stuff.

  THIS MAKES SHEDDING THINGS SO EASY. I RECENTLY BOUGHT A HOUSE AND I HAVE GRADUATE SCHOOL LOANS SO I GET CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL ALL THE TIME AND I FEEL SAFER IF THE INFO ON IT WENT INTO A SHREDDER. NOT ONLY DOES IT SHRED INTO STRIPS I CUT ACROSS SO ITS TINY PIECES THAT CAN NEVER BE PLACED TOGETHER TO GATHER INFORMATION. SO NOW WHEN I GET THE MAIL I JUST COME HOME AND SHRED THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE!!

  This shredder has never performed well.  After 8 months, it now turns on by randomly by itself...even after cleaning.  It bogs down with 3 sheets of paper and will jam if I try 4 or more sheets.

  I needed a new shredder and so I figured I'd give this Amazon Basics one a try.  So far, I've shredded numerous junk mail and other items into the shredder without any problems such as jams and over heating.  The one thing I did notice though is that the shredded paper is slightly larger than the other cross shred shredder that I had before but nonetheless, it does what it's supposed to do.  If you have sensitive info that you are trying to shred then I would probably look elsewhere because with some of the shredded paper you can see the words on the strip of paperUpdate: I barely used this shredder (bought it less than a month ago) and its already not working.  The reverse works but when I put any piece of paper into the shredder in the forward mode, it makes a constant him noise and will not feed paper through the shredder.  I've had good luck with Amazon Basic products before and this the first time where I am dissatisfied.

  Used the shredder off and on for two days. Two or three sheets at a time, in sets of 3 to 5 feeds and then let it rest for 10 to 30 minutes. Motor never got hot the first day. Second day I was finishing up and ran it just a tiny bit harder with lots of down time. Red light never came on. It stopped all functions except for the green light. Reverse does not work. No jam at all. Turned it off and let it rest for two hours. The safety switch that touches the basket works fine.  Nothing. Green light is on steadily. Placing a piece of paper into the feed the green lights gets a little brighter and the mechanism ‘clicks’. No motor. The shredder is shot in two days of light use. I already threw away the packaging and the bother of doing my own along with the cost of shipping it back is not worth the time and money. Right off a $30 loss. Buy a better machine. ADDITION: I had forgotten just how easy it is to return an item to Amazon. I rarely shop here. Drop it off at UPS or Kohl's. You don't even have to package it. Amazon sends you the mailing label on email. Done. So I got my money back. ALSO, I do think that I got a lemon. Found out that my son had the EXACT model in his office and he ran it HARD for over two years without a hitch.

  While the shredder works fine there are some flaws in the Amazon ad.  First off the 6 sheet shredder is not cross cut as the heading says.  Secondly the 6 sheet has an opening to put other scrap paper into the basket, while the 8 sheet is completely closed.  Don't get the 2 mixed up.  In fact they are so different they should not even be in the same ad.  Very poor choice by Amazon.  Which accounts for some of the bad reviews.

  I bought this to destroy old records and it worked good the first day; seemed to run a while before getting hot and easily shredded cards and paper. However, it claims to be able to take 8 pages at a time but it jammed on me several times with just 3-4! Now, not even a month after use, it suddenly pauses in the middle of shredding (and it’s not hot, it will do this right after turning it on). I can only use half of it because there’s a jam in the other half that I can’t get out. I was only putting in papers 1-2 at a time...I wouldn’t recommend this shredder.

  ☆☆☆☆☆ REALLY 5 stars! only gave 4 stars because it's so new. But LOVE this! Read many reviews and decided to try this... 1) my previous paper shredder had a mesh metal bottom to it, so I feel the durability of this will be better because it's basically like a plastic  garbage can bottom. 2) it's noisy, but definitely not like my old one.  3) have not tried 12 papers, but did great with 10 sheets of paper. 4) did not overheat and was able to get rid of months of papers as my previous shredder would burn out after 1/2 hour and I would have to resume later.

  The quality of the shredder isn’t the highest but for the price there’s no arguing. It does good job at its intended purpose and that’s to shred. I found myself having reversing the blades and then running it foward to clear the blades a few a times through the process of shredding years worth of papers but not enough to make you not like the product. My only gripe with this item is that it don’t shred the materials into smaller finer pieces but like I alluded to earlier , You get what you pay for. All in all good product happy with it. Just be careful and don’t switch the settings too fast because you will see a flash of light coming from the back ventilation slots near where the motors mounted indicating a spark so make sure you switch the setting one by one, nice and easy like a transmission

  It has become such a fiasco ordering online.  We were going to return this; however, we do have another plastic bin that fits for underneath so we are going to keep it.  It came with a smashed corner on the bottom that was completely gone with the pieces in the bag.  The box was not damaged at all, which is odd.  The on/off switch does not work; it is loose and does nothing.  We did discover that if you take the top off, it shuts off automatically rather than having to unplug it for each interval, but the on/off switch would be MUCH BETTER.  So okay, we can suffer through.  Returning is becoming a nightmare.  Also, the top is quite heavy.  It did not come with any invoice, just the manual.  Bottom line, we just want people to know it came damaged so be weary when ordering.  It is daunting going through reviews, and this one had very good ones.  ? ?  If it does not at least shred properly within the warranty, then we will return it.  We have time on our hands now being self-quarantined so we just want to get the shredding done...

  I shredded old documents and filled 2 up bags, compacted. The teeth still sounds sharp. The motor, gears and teeth are heavy when lifted during emptying. I had an old shredder that died, different brand, roughly same cost, but much lighter which explains why it jams do much and died after a couple months of light usage. So I'm hoping this one will last. My only dislike at this time is the plastic bucket. It is somewhat flimsy with no grasping hand hole to empty the contents. Without any hand holes or handles, you can't pick it up and move it easily. I would like to see an improvement in the bucket design, either with handles or latches to the motor, for ease of portability. Then that would be a perfect 5-star rating.

  Cut all of 10 sheets of paper and promptly died. never more than 2-3 sheets tried replacing the fuse, which is not johnny homeowner replaceable, its soldered no luck, bypassed sensors no luck, no paper jams, spins by hand, no reverse, no auto, and since I decided to pop it open, no warranty. Only thing that works is the safety lever liights up its diode when depressed. im thinking the  relay took a dump or the motor itself died or something loose.Total waste of 35 bucks

  This is a QUIET shredder considering its 15 sheet capacity compared to all the others we have had here at work!!  Love it!  I would recommend this for a quiet work office or home.  We bought a Amazon Basics 17 sheet a year ago for another office and it sounds like a diesel truck running in your office, but this AB15 is smoother and much, much  quieter.  It cuts through 8-10 sheets really good and with little strain.  When shred 11-15 sheets it does strain a bit but still cuts chops them easily.  I like that fact that it has a flapper to tell you when the bin is full rather than a photocell cell so there are no false 'full' indicators. But if your using plastic trash bag liners like we do you need to make sure the bag is properly installed so the flapper does not get stuck on the bag.  I like the manual on/off/auto switches on this one has better than those pesky electronic buttons you have to press several times. The shredder opening is rather tight compared the old Fellows shredder it replaced. You need to line the papers up straight and square to shredder opening which is little annoying.  And one last thing is the delay when starting.  It takes the shredder 1-2 seconds to start running after you put the paper in the slot.  I bought the 4 year warranty just in case.  Cheers.

  Just a little over 2 years, this shredder starting acting up and stopped working. I bought this needing a basic shredder knowing this was an inexpensive model. Its OK and did what I needed it to do, to simply be a convenient desk-side shredder for light home office use. My biggest complaint is the overrating of 6 sheet shredding that's more realistically about 3. I took it apart and found the gear mechanisms were jammed and found opposing rotating cutters to be loose and not turning smoothly that most likely jammed into each other. I freed up the assembly and got it to work again only to jam once more. Decided to leave screws off of the housing for quick access to free up again if it got stuck. Its been working OK now for awhile but will use it till it completely dies. Caveat emptor, you get what you pay for.

  The only thing, minor, I do  not like is that the shredded items do not fall in an easily removable container.  You have to lift off the shredder top, place it on the floor, and then carry the rest of the unit, where the shredded stuff is, to your garbage.  I guess you can always put a plastic bag in the unit, but you still have to remove the top.  I try to avoid too much plastic stuff.  C'est la vie!

  Save your time and sanity and put a little bit more money towards a better shredder.I would leave the shredder plugged in and on auto. I did this for about a month. One day, I kept hearing a whirring sound coming from somewhere in the house. The sound was coming from a very overworked and very hot empty shredder churning away with no papers or blockage that would set off the auto shredding feature. I quickly unplugged the shredder. I then set the shredder into the OFF position when I wasn't using it. This worked well enough because I could set the shredder to ""auto,"" which was now an ON option, when I was ready to shred some documents. Keeping it unplugged is probably the safer option.This shredder would stop shredding after light use and often times no amount of coaxing could prompt the shredder to continue working. I would unplug it and walk away frustrated. 10-30 minutes later I would return to try again. Sometimes it would shred normally, but other times it would just make an electrical click and continue to sit there useless.Shredding papers with this shredder is not worth the frustration. I only shred occasional bills and other rare documents with personal information on it. It got very light use over the time I had it. Now it lives somewhere in a garbage bin.

  I had 12 sheets of paper stapled together. The paper jammed even though it was below the 15 sheet level. The reverse function dislodged the paper preventing a crippling jam. I like the volume of paper the basket holds and that I can just tip the basket into a trash bag without paper pieces flying everywhere. I like the see through slot on the basket so I have an idea how much more shredding I can do. I like the red light that indicates the bin is full. It isn't quiet, however, it is quieter than the shredder I got rid of and the shredders that my friends have. Just pulling the bin out without having to lift up the shredder blade mechanism is great!! Very happy after filling 5 30 gallon trash bags over 2 days.

  It does a great job. With all the free time I had this summer, I shredded all the documents, etc that needed to be shredded.  I then started shredding cardboard boxes after soaking them in water, peeling them apart so the cardboard becomes thinner.  After they dried, I shredded these items.  I compost all paper products. I hate throwing out the boxes.  I have had the product for two months and it has never overheated.  I have put it through a lot of shredding.  So far it’s been perfect.  The only negative thing is the size of the container.

  When it came time to replace my old shredder which served me well for years, I narrowed my purchase options  down to two shredders. The Amazon Basics 15 sheet Cross Cut and a comparable shredder from a different manufacture. I initially opted for the other brand because it was less expensive. After all, how much difference can there  be in a shredder ? Well, I found out the hard way ,there is a big difference in quality and features.The first shredder arrived DOA, so I could not compare operation or noise. What I can compare is the build quality and features. The initial  shredder was DOA out of the box, you had to remove shredder head to empty bin, build quality was much cheaper, it had no casters and did not have all the features the Amazon Basics provided.The Amazon Basics arrived well packed and fully assembled....and it was mot DOA  :) .  Setup is a matter of taking it out of the box and reading the manual. You do not have to remove the shredder head to empty. The slide out bin is well designed and handy. The installed casters make it very easy to move. The power  switch  and indicator lights are placed well, easy to see and operate. The unit is very quiet compared to my old shredder. It has handled all shredding tasks with ease so far. Construction is clearly superior to the first shredder I returned.Though I have only had the shredder a short time, I believe it too will provide years of service as did my old shredder. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.

  We haven't had it very long, but so far, it seems pretty good.  My husband is thrilled with it because it's so quiet.  Both of us were surprised at how quiet it was.  He hated bothering to shred anything, he'd toss everything on top of the old one and let me do it, but the first time he tried this one, he said he loved it.  The bin will hold a lot more than our old one and while that one lasted a long time, it would clog when it got full because it kept trying to do more and we couldn't always tell it was full without checking the bin first.  We'll be able to see when this gets full.  I think we'll continue to like this one.

  Does as it say. Will not shred more than 6 pieces at a time. I use to leave it plugged in and on 'auto' so I could just quickly destroy whatever....until I came home after about 5 months of having the item. I came home after being gone for 10 hours that day and the shredder was running by itself and my house smelled like something was burning and you could see a haze in the room. It scared me to think how long it had actually been running and how much longer it would have been to catch fire. I leave it off and unplugged at all times now. When I plug it in now, the 'auto' is on a continuous run (even without paper) - before it would only run when you put paper into the slot.

  My previous high-capacity shredder broke, and it did strips instead of the security ""cris-cross"" shredding, so it was time to get a new one. But I didn't want to pay through the nose as I don't use the shredder much. This does the job. Just be aware that you truly can't put more than 6 sheets through. If you stick a full envelope in there, it will get stuck. Take the time to feed a few pages at a time and you won't have any issues. Overall, great home office shredder if you don't need high capacity.

  I got this after getting tired of ripping up paper products to build my compost pile. This little guy works great for letter sized paper and torn down pieces of cardboard from all the Amazon boxes I’ve been getting. At around 6 pieces of paper you do hear it start to struggle a bit so I try not to do too much at a time. The one major gripe I have with this is that the width of the paper must be no wider than standard letter sized. Having kids who love arts and crafts, I get all sized paper waste. I solved this by folding those in half. Other than that this has been going strong every day for a month.

  It took a long time for me to post this review.  I hope amazon does not sell this product any longer because it is AWFUL.  If I put one junk mail envelope that is very thin in this shredder it blocks up and can't go through.  I mean it can't be more than 4 sheets total for this thin envelope to go through and it jams the machine.  I have to get a pair of scissors and try to shred the paper so it can be forced through.

  I’ve been using this for about a year now. I’m not a big paper shredder, I don’t have a home office or anything I just use it as needed here and there. For my needs, his thing works great. It shreds the paper like it should and doesn’t really ever jam. Because it’s only a 1-4 papers ever few weeks if hasn’t gotten a lot of use or any large stacks of paper going threw it but so far the blades are staying sharp.My only complaint is that after I emptied it the first time when I put the top back on the can part broke. I wasn’t being rough or aggressive just simply placing it back on and it broke, has a giant crack down the side now. I can still shred paper easily,paper isn’t lose or anything, it’s just annoying that it’s broken. Seems like it should have been more sturdy.

  I've been using this shredder for about two months now and I have been very happy with it. This is a basic shredder which should meet the needs of a regular household. It does a great job shredding CD's and credit cards as well. This is probably one of the best shredders there is at this price point.Pros:- Price - When compare to other shredders out there, the price for this one is great.- Utility - Meets the basic needs of a regular household. Shred papers, CD's and credit cards.Cons:- The basket is too small and needs to be emptied frequently. (my reason for giving this product a 4 star)- Runs for only 10 minutes at a time. After which you should let it cool down for about half hour prior to using again.

  Great shredder.  We've shred over a thousand sheets of paper (lubricated) without and issues.  Nice quiet operation and very easy to use.  Very good value for that price for a 15-sheet shredder.  We looked at comparable models at a few office stores and all were over the price of the Amazon model.  I shred a few CD's just to test and there were no problems.  We never did get into an ""over heat"" situation.  Appears to be well built.  Good product from Amazon.

  I got this to obviously shred stuff and it works really well. I decided to test the shredders ability to handle a large quantity of work.  Took nearly 3 paper grocery bags to find a neat little feature. It has an over heat warning light and a sensor that kicks it off when it starts to get too warm so you don't burn out the motor. Another neat little feature is the kill switch it has if you don't set it properly on the bin or if it falls off. The power is cut so you don't risk catching your fingersThe only thing I don't like is how there was no cover for the blades when it first came. I went to pull out of a dark box and sliced my finger and promptly dropped it on my foot. Yay me! Also like to point out it is a pretty heavy shredder. Good news is either my foot nor the shredder broke!

  Bought this shredder about a year and a half ago. Very pleased with its ability to shred documents. I bought it specifically to be a cheap method to get rid of some stuff i had that i wanted to burn but no longer had a place to burn them in. After purchasing everybody in the house decided they had stuff to shred as well, go figure...I will need to upgrade to a bigger one or maybe one i can put over a trash can as the bucket on this one needs to be emptied often if you shred alot, and it will get paper shreds and dust particles everywhere if you overfill when you finally go to empty it out. Still I give it 5-stars as I'm happy with the purchase. I didn't think I would need anything bigger as i didn't plan to do so much shredding but here i am thinking/looking to upgrade.

  I was expecting this shredder to be a bit more ""commercial use friendly"", but it wasn't. However, its bin size is comparable to the little black trash cans they use to have in the classrooms in school. All in all, it shreds one or two envelopes at a time depending on the thickness/content. But, if you have a ""mass load"" (like I did), you can't just cram it in there. It took me about 2 hours to shred a year's worth of mostly junk mail!! If I had to do it over again, I would have just gone with a regular shredder, but this is not bad.

  I have a very small home business with a very small office. My wife and I have some investments and she has a small portfolio. We get so much mail and it piles up very quickly. I never imagined needing a shredder, but some of  this information must be rendered unretrievable. Enter the Amazon Basics 6-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder. It is perfect for our needs. I've used it to clear out our accumulated pile of documents in a matter of minutes. The thing gets the job done for household and very small business needs.In all honesty, do follow the recommendations in the guide. I overheated mine by feeding it too much too fast and it just stopped working. As I was told it would. It will shred credit cards easily, but if you go with six sheets of paper at a time, you can hear it straining just a bit. No matter. if you get in the habit of shredding as you go, there is no problem.One small caveat. I bought the the bottle of oil that was suggested as a bundle on Amazon. I have no complaints about the oil, but upon reading the directions, I learned that simple vegetable oil will suffice, so you can save a couple of bucks that way, by not buying the oil, when you likely have it in your kitchen.Overall, great, basic product, well-made and perfect for the needs I have outlined. Highest recommendation.

  Price was right. But unit broke while shredding thin sets of bills. Nothing thick.Did not get enough value from this value-priced unit.  Not used to such low quality from Amazon branded products.

  Really disappointed with this product and the terrible customer service you get when you reach someone in the Philippines or India when you try to get help.  When you first get this item, it will look nice and shiny and you’ll think you got a good deal.  But Amazon Basics is poor quality so one day you’ll go to shred something and surprise, it will have stopped working.  You’ll think maybe you blew a fuse and your outlet isn’t working but then you’ll realize it is just dead.dead.dead.  You’ll reach out to Amazon.  You’ll get someone in a foreign land who will tell you they cant do anything and you’ll learn your lesson not to shop generic products from Amazon.  And you’ll also realize Amazon doesn’t really care about you as a customer.

  This is a good shredder.  It can munch through pages pretty quickly.  I had to shred a big pile of old financial papers (if they were stacked the stack would have been 5-6 feet tall).  Of course that took awhile and the unit overheated several times (it stops until it cools down and then it will start up again).  The overheating switch is a good safety feature.To me the biggest drawback is that it is a little loud, but I never compared it to another shredder.  I watch TV while shredding, so I just turn up the volume on the TV.I found that the shredder was most efficient when I was shredding a max of 3 or 4 sheets, although it can shred up to about 8 or so - it just did that slower.

  We checked with major office supply outlets and also online for a paper shredder that would handle at least eight pages, shredded through cross cuts, and would shred credit cards.  We looked at the user ratings on the various sites that included Office Depot, Staples, bed Bath and beyond, and the like. The Amazon shredder has great user reviews, was less expensive than supposed comparable shredders elsewhere, And had all the features we wanted. Honestly, we saw shredders at two and three times the cost of the Amazon product.  When it arrived, of course we “checked it out.” Extremely impressed and it is exactly as advertised, at a great price.

  5 yrs in, still going strong. Weekly use.Pros: simple to use, reasonably sized, reasonable noise, GREAT value for the 30 dollar price 2015.Cons: shreds only 3-5 mins before needing cooldown, overheats too easily, jams too easily, tips over more than should when empty, no wheels, bin size could be bigger, security level shred ""only"" to P-3.I just upgraded to bonsaii 4s30 for $200 and change. Much quieter, much bigger bin, much higher feed capacity, much higher warranty, higher security level shred (from p3 to p5), and promises to shred continuously for 60x as long (yes you read that right) without rest.

  I shred loan documents which are over 100 pages and to shred them 12 pages at a time is such a waste of time for me and if I try to fit it more it jams.  It's loud, messy and I regret buying it. I missed the return period.  What a bummer.

  The cross cuts that this shredder makes to a document are too far apart resulting in long uncut strips of document up to 2.5 inches. To deal with this issue, make sure any sensitive information on your document enters vertically into the shredder so the blades will cut between the consecutive letters and numbers you want to obliterate. If you place the information horizontally through the blades then it is possible that an entire 2.5 inch strip of consecutive letters and numbers will be left intact.If you have a document that was printed landscape instead of portrait or on a piece of paper that is wider than the intake/mouth of the shredder then you will have to rip/cut the document in half before feeding it into the shredder.Due to these limitations, you have to be thoughtful when using this shredder. If you are looking for a shredder you can use quickly to destroy several sheets of sensitive information of various portrait/landscape orientations and paper sizes then this shredder is not right for you.

  I'm a lazy guy kind of shredding person. I get countless amounts of junk mail, credit card offers, etc...that just dont stop coming no matter how many times you unsubscribe or tell them paperless....Anyway, to my point of this shredder, this thing is a beast. It is exactly what I was looking for. I have been able to drop whole envelopes(with contents still inside) at this thing handles it like a champ. No issues, quietly and effortlessly.  My previous shredder would lock up and over heat trying to do about 6 pages, and it was an 8 page shredder and would only rin about 6-8 mins before shutting down from heat. This new shredder went 25 mins of straight shredding, with no hesitation. Only big issue is the size of the basket. Wish it was bigger, but I just mashed down the clipping, push the drawer back in, and it's good to go again. Its quiet too, so that's a bonus. Very happy with this purchase!

  I should have spent more money on a better quality shredder - this machine works, but it's only useful for brief occasional shredding, and I have so much to shred!  My trusty old shredder that I've used forever finally died, and I miss it so.  This one is loud, slow, and overheats very quickly.  I'm disappointed, but I was trying to save money.  It works for small jobs, and I just should have made a different choice.

  Good for the price and seems well made.1- This has to be the Largest cross cut shred I've ever seen.  Shredded pieces are HUGE, maybe 50% wider and longer than normal.  So if you are looking for real security, rather than general security, buy something else.2- The basket is solid plastic and you can't see how full it is except through a small opening in the top.3- To empty the basket you need to lift the top shredder housing off and set it down.  This causes a small snow storm of shredded paper.4- The finger tabs to lift the top shredder housing and the tabs to fill the entire unit (ie to move it) are in the same place and you are going to guess wrong.

  This one is being shipped back for a replacement. If I wasn't confined to home I'd go out and buy another brand. The switch jiggles and seems really cheap, it takes it a bit too long to come on when switched to on, the slot where the paper goes in is too skinny, even with trying to be very careful to keep the number of sheets low it collects pieces of the shreds on both sides that have to be manually removed. It will also just stop running for no reason, and nothing can make it start back until it suddenly will start running. If I didn't need a shredder really bad right now I'd just send it back and wait until I could get to a store. Beware and choose another brand if possible.

  This thing is great! I didn't count the number of pages but I know I was putting more than 8 pages in every once in a while. It handles everything from credit cards to paper. The first day I got it I was shredding documents like the FBI was knocking at my door.

  I replaced a decades old small shredded with an AmazonBasics 15 sheet cross- cut shredder.  I ran that new machine on the day it was received, to the extent that I had to dump the basket three times.  This model is impressive.  While I only shredded perhaps 7 or 8 sheets of paper at a time, I found it to be quiet, shredded without straining, and was designed to align paper perpendicular to the slot. The basket is large, and the machine stops when it is full, displaying a red LED.  But in the process of pulling the basket out to dump it, I was disappointment that a small amount of shredded paper fell onto the machine’s floor.  Perhaps those pieces would be covered when the basket was returned, but to me that’s a disappointment.  Perhaps a solution of sorts would be to check the basket’s window to observe the fill level, and dump the basket earlier than necessary.

  This is the best shredder I have ever owned. The shredder I owned before this one died was too easily this one can shred several papers at once and cards easily. I had more than 2 bags alf papers to shred. I knew I needed another shredder but kept forgetting to purchase one so I had tons of this waiting to be shredded. When I got this shredder I spent hours(no joke, at lest 4 hours shredding) and this shredder just kept going and going and going. At one point I started to worry because I had no clue I has so much to do but after waiting too long I just wanted to get it all done so I shredded everything and had not one problem. After months this shredder is still going strong. I can't recommend this enough. It is well worth the money and then some.

  I bought this for home use.  Never used it to shred more than 3 sheets at a time, then 2, then 1.  Dumped full bin, cleared paper stuck in cutters & oiled regularly, thinking that that would fix the problem... nope!  Just makes the most awful grinding noises, the the light goes off (never got the red light).  Wait a few minutes then shred another handful of sheets, one at a time, until the grinding noise starts up again & light goes off.  Moderate nose level while operating.  Difficult to remove lid using only one hand.  Problems started at one year of ownership--not worth it!

  I have owned a few home shredders over the years and they all seem to burn out from basic use.  For the price, this was worth the try to see if it was a suitable replacement.  So far, I like it.Does produce a nice size shred on documents.  Can reliably shred 6 pages at the time for about 10 minutes before needing a break.  The credit card shredding did not work very well.  I used the lubricating sheets Amazon recommends for this, and it seems to help (but probably could just use some WD40 to get a similar result).Glad I have this at home for shredding documents with sensitive info on it.  Has held up well for almost 2 years.  Gets the job done - recommend!

  Good basic home office shredder at an excellent price. Stay within the operating parameters (six sheet max and two minute run time) and you'll be fine. If you need to do more than that on a regular basis, spend the money and buy a more capable machine.  I've had mine over two years and have on few occasions worked it way beyond its design, ending up with over six cubic feet of compressed shredded paper in a single day. The overheat function works as advertised- it shuts itself down and works again after a half hour or so of cooling off. It still works well with the exception of the switch- now when you turn it on, it runs continuously even without paper being fed into it. I'd buy it again- mine has been taking a licking and keeps on ticking and has reduced years of documents/papers to a manageable level. One last suggestion- if you have LOTS of documents to shred (and if I had it do over again) I'd look for a commercial shredding firm. Some credit unions and banks offer free ""shred events"" several times a year where you can bring documents to the credit union/ bank where a commercial shredding outfit will shred them for you- it's a big time saver. Even if they don't, commercial shredding isn't too expensive, especially if your time means anything to you.

  So this is probably one of the cheapest shredders you can buy but it works pretty well.  I had a pile of old mail, and it was definitely up to the task.  Make sure to open the envelopes first then shred stuff one or two pages at a time.  Use common sense.  I actually pushed it pretty hard, but gave it a break to cool down.  Also listen to it don’t let it bog down too much.  If you don’t want to deal with opening envelopes, or need to shred stuff every day I would recommend spending more and getting something better.But if you just need a basic shredder every now and then this one’s actually pretty good.

  One Couple. Twenty odd years of 'How long should we keep this document?' One major move. One $25 shredder. a dozen bags of 'confetti' later...We got this to help us dispose of two decades of old bills, pay stubs, bank statements, and the like. When we moved house, we decided taking the past with us was not needed and, after verifying with an accountant, got to shredding.Yes, this is for light 'home' use. It took us about a week of little five minute shred marathons to complete the task, but we have 6 banker boxes of unneeded files DONE.Yes, it overheats and jams if you do not follow the directions TO THE LETTER. Do yourself a favor and separate that six page credit card bill into three two-page sections.But all-in-all, a great little shredder. For what it would have cost to have a professional do ONE box, we got it all done. And now we have a nice shredder to avoid this issues in the future.

  I got this to replace a super-basic shredder I've had for probably 10 years now that could only handle 4 sheets at a time, and just barely.  This unit handles more with ease, but there are a few things I don't like about it.  The intake slot isn't much wider than a standard 8.5x11 piece of paper, which can be annoying when you're having to reach back behind you when feeding it.  Also, it seems to have some sort of delayed start, where you have to hold the paper in the slot for a second before the shredding starts.  Lastly, there's an LED that remains lit while the unit is on, which to me is a bit unnecessary; I can see it fading or burning out long before the shredder has reached the end of its life.  But, it works and works pretty well.

  I was faced with a MOUNTAIN of personal shredding stored up by a friend, two clothes hampers full. She had an old ribbon shredder that worked and I had some time. Halfway through the first bin a single paperclip snuck by me and irrevocably broke her shredder. Theres a chain office supply store (rhymes with maples) on the corner, and since I broke it I was going to replace it. Cheapest they had was a 6 sheet shredder for $79.99. Hard pass. Hit up Amazon while in said store and found this 12 sheet cross-cut for 1/3 less, delivered in 1 day. The cross cut meant that what generated 3 bags of paper waste for 1/2 a bin, now generated 2 bags for a bin and a half. Fast, quiet, inexpensive, and so far quite dependable without a single overheating incident. LOVE this product!

  For some odd reason, I get a sense of satisfaction seeing tiny shredded strips of paper and credit cards. This shredder comes in two parts - the bin on the bottom that holds the shredded remains and the top that has everything else. It's pretty straight forward and generally safe to us. The only word of caution is don't lift the shredded only on the top part while in use because there isn't a ""locking"" mechanism between the two parts.Pros:- Affordable price and does what it is suppose to do. Also, it is pretty lightweight- The shredder will only operate when there's something near the feeding mouth - you can leave it plugged in and turned out at all times.Cons- Depending on your luck, it may shred your card in a way where some information remains intact- Lack of a locking mechanism.I would recommend this shredder for any home office.

  My Mom has been wanting a new shredder ever since her old one broke down. So, I went to Amazon, and the first thing that popped up is this. Browsed on the reviews, saw the rating and immediately hit the buy button! It came the next day right on my doorstep and my Mom got to shredding. It has easy button control and pretty straight forward. There's the continues shred button, off, and the automatic option. It does it's job, the noise is level is just like any other standard shredder, average. I like the design and aesthetic of it. Very sleek and polished design. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because it came with a dent and scratch on the silver lid part of it. Not a big deal, but if you're someone who's very particular and notices little things like me, it might bother you. But overall, great for the price, sturdy, great quality, and good design. Highly recommended.

  I am very well pleased with this paper shredder.  After 20-30 years my old Fellows strip-cut Shredder started to not cut all the way through the paper. It was time to get a new paper shredder.  I chose the Amazon Basics 15 cross-cut shredder because of the time before I would need it to cool down.  It has a 20 minute on with a 45 minute cool down.  I have so far shredded Two 30 gal bags with no problem.  The shredder never overheated nor did I have to stop for cooldown.  Two days ago I shredded for over 2 hours with no problem.  I shredded some credit cards and a CD with no problem.  The waste basket is a little messy.  The first time I emptied the basket I had 1/3 of the paper on the floor.  I figured it out that if you use the longer side (Front side with window) to put in the bag first works the best with less of a mess.  A prior review I had saw mentioned that the power cord is only 5 feet long and wished it was 6 feet.  Yes, I agree it would have been better if it was 6 feet.  The only problem I had was a paper jam 2 days ago.  After the jam, the shredder constantly ran while in the “Auto (On)” mode.  I followed the troubleshooting instructions in the manual with no success.  I cleaned both the inside and outside with no luck.  I called Amazon Basics customer service and today I received a replacement and returned the old one to Kohl’s with no hassle.  Great service!Absolutely, yes I would recommend this 15 cross-cut shredder.

  This product sold by Amazon just stopped working. They told me over the phone that it was not able to be replaced (I just want a working shredder). Which is funny because if I bought it from a competitor of amazon, that’s force that company to give me excellent customer service. I’m also confused why it says there is warranty service for the product until 10/22/20, but all they can do for me is give me 5 dollars as a condolence.

  Right from the beginning, as early as a month after receiving this unit, I went to shred a credit card in the slot provided. This was a costly mistake. I WOULD NOT recommend this shredder to be used for any more than SIX sheets of paper and definitely not a CC. When using 8 sheets on 2 occasions, this unit seemed to be working way too hard.

  I like this shredder. I find it to be pretty quiet. It is more quiet than my previous shredder. It has a big window on the front so you can see how pull the basket is. It does good cross-court for the most part. I did find some pieces weren't cut all the way and I have showed what those pieces looked like. Most were cut just fine. The box and packaging was undamaged but the top was cracked. Looks like it was damaged before packaging. I got a small refund for that issue. At most I have done 10 pages at a time without an issue. It hasn't overheated with about 10 mins of shred time. My previous shredder would overheat after a few minutes. Overall a good price and shreds pretty good.

  When I took it out of the box I was amazed at how light it was. In hindsight, that should have been my first clue.Found it a little difficult to get the right position for the paper the first time I tried it. That's because there is a handle right where the paper feed is. Tried several single sheets and it was quiet and the paper shredded easily. (however the shreds are on the larger size in comparison to my old shredder). Ok, so this can take up to 8 sheets, I tried 4. JAMMED! Not just a little but jammed to the point I couldn't unjam it at all. I followed the unjam instructions in the manual to no avail. Wow, I've had it for 10 minutes and it died. Don't bother, don't fall for the price, get a better product. Amazon I suggest you NOT use this as an Amazon choice. I will think twice before ordering anything you pick as a ""choice"". Just printed the return slip.....

  Great value for the money, and very functional.  It is still a little loud, but it works well.  The design makes me feel safe to use, though the top part is a bit heavy.  It is small enough to fit under a desk or side table.  Because of the noise and the top-heaviness, I gave this 4 out of 5 stars.  You still have to be careful when removing the top (which should be shut off before removal) in order to dump the shredded debris.

  This was a replacement shredder for my 15 year old Brother shredder so lots to compare it to. First - it is VERY quiet in comparison and does a super job shredding. What I miss, however, is the ability to pull out the basket and dump it....I don't like having to remove the top to dump the basket. It usually results in shreddings all over the floor when I place the top/shredder mechanism on the floor to dump the basket. No complaints on anything else. Probably my fault I didn't investigate further.....but for the money it's a real work horse.

  Well, I had this shredder just about five weeks when it just died -- no warning, no malfunction, it just quit working altogether. Fortunately, Amazon is sending me a replacement unit so we'll see how that one holds up.Just a couple of things to look at, that I learned from using it:1) It says it is an 8 sheet shredder; 8 sheets might be pushing the limit a bit. I'd go with no more than 6.2) Credit card slot: this shredder had a very hard time shredding a single credit card, so I wouldn't really count on it for that. A pair of scissors might do better.On the plus side, is is relatively quiet during use, and has a small footprint so it's unobtrusive.

  Jams frequently if you try to shred more than 3 sheets. Paper (even one sheet) often gets pulled in at an angle even though initially squarely aligned.  It vibrates and makes loud grinding noises while operating.  The very-heavy top makes emptying the basket difficult.  It creates a lot of paper dust.  The method of oiling the blades specified in the manual is messy and cumbersome.  After only 2 months, mine stopped working completely - after shredding 1 letter-sized, regular-weight sheet.

  Wanted something to shred those credit-card applications and other obvious junk mail without needing to open the envelope. This does it perfectly.Pro: Had it for 9 months, and don't think i've overloaded it yet. Noticeably quiet for its power. Small-enough cross-shredded pieces. Flat top for stacking those ""let me look through these one more time before i shred them"" documents.Con: 1) Annoying VERY LONG power delay when inserting a sheet. Never know if it's positioned improperly, (there is an annoying ridge in the feeder slot that catches papers) or the thing is just thinking. 2) The receptacle bins are never big enough on any of these things, but this one is particularly small (9"" deep, 12"" high, 12"" wide). It's only about ¾ of the height of the deceptive front cover.Would buy again. Perfect price/strength for shredding the daily junk mail and the occasional stack of accumulated papers.

  Arrived and product is excellent!  Have had a collection of papers for six years adding up that needed shredding.  Was concerned that the shredder might not handle the amount.  Started shredding and it is a great shredder.  The button for overheating came on after the third time I used it for over 40 minutes, and I stopped, put it on off, and unplugged it.  Used it the next few days and it works perfectly.  It had easy controls and the window that shows shredding is helpful, my last shredder didn't have that.  For the price, it being delivered and having years of shredding ahead of me, (will take a month at least to get it all caught up and then use it daily for the mail from now on), I am pleased and feel it was a good buy.

  I would not recommend buying this if you have a lot of shredding. I was really disappointed with how poorly this works. It’s supposed to have a 6 page limit, but it starts struggling w/ 1 really thick pieces of paper or 3 regular papers. The unit gets hot very quickly and will just stop working. You have to wait a long time for it to cool down. It gets hot even quicker if you try to shred more than 3 pages at a time. I would only recommend this unit for someone who occasionally shreds documents at home. This would never work for an office setting. The positives are it’s affordable, compact, powerful when shredding 1-3 papers at a time, and makes small shredded papers to protect your privacy.

  This shredder is/was Amazon recommended.  I agree.  However, the first one arrived completely DOA (non-working). Amazon promptly replaced it and I have had no issues with the replacement to date. I am quite satisfied with the power and functionality with one small exception that is probably typical of all home shredders... The feed mechanism occasionally gets packed small shred pieces that need to be worked out.  Good value for the price.  As for sturdiness, I just wish these things weren't  so top heavy with a powerful motor sitting atop a lightweight plastic bin. These designs need an attachable or expandable foot/base that provides better stability.

  Now on my 4th paper shredder, I feel more comfortable giving my opinion. Having just finished shredding about 10 lbs of paper, I think I can write about this product..GOOD: reasonable price, strong motor, higher paper capacity, easy-to-use, durable. This is a higher quality product. As for heating issues, let's just say that I got tired of shredding before the shredder overheated.COULD BE IMPROVED: The 12-sheet capacity is true. But I think everything has to be fed exactly to make that happen. The bottom wastebasket portion needs to have more weight on the bottom to prevent tipping. The length of the opening should be bigger to accommodate misaligned 8.5 x 11 pieces of paper.

  This shredder immediately broke after using it to shred normal paper documents. It seemed like a cheap plastic machine but some positive reviews made me give it a try. The next day, the red light indicating misalignment was on and it will no longer function. DO NOT BUY THIS!

  I ordered a replacement and will update this review when the replacement arrives.For the 20 minutes I used this, with prescribed cool-down periods, this shredder worked great.  Then it just stopped.  No apparent paper jam, nothing looked at all out of line.  It just.quit.working.I'm hoping I just got a dud.  For the less than an half hour I used it, it was great.  Grrrrr!UPDATE:  Received the replacement within 2 days.  It worked wonderfully for a lot of shredding that day.  Have not used it since, but did not exhibit the issues the first unit did.  Revising my rating up, but only to a 3, because of the first bad unit.

  First shredder arrived broken but Amazon the return & exchange process simple..  Package was picked up at my home & new shredder arrived 2 days later.  Like the size of the shredder basket - can run it for approx 2 weeks before having to empty it.  And, the shredder itself works very well, cutting paper into unrecognizably small pieces.  My only complaint - though not a biggie - is that shredder is a bit louder than my last shredder.

  After extensive research I bought this for my home office to shred tax returns, bills, brokerage statements and junk mail.  I selected cross cut over microcut for the following reasons:  faster, quieter, longer run time and product longevity.  The shredded material would be impossible to put back together.  I like the removable bin which is EASY to empty.If you are on the fence, buy it and you won’t be disappointed.

  The shredder in our office died while I was in the middle of clearing the previous year's sensitive documents. When replacing it I decided to spend the extra $2 to ""upgrade"" to an 8-page shredder. What a difference! Not only is this one a tad quieter than the 6-page it buzz saws through paper. Much like the 6-page if I'm doing a lot of shredding it's a bad idea to try and send the max number of recommended pages through over and over as it will quickly overheat. But it handles 4-5 pages like a champ. Made my box of ""to be shredded"" documents empty in no time.

  We bought this shredder for our personal use. Which it does a great job! Then we brought it to the office and it works great! Our big older shredder bit the dust and had to bring in a replacement until we get a new one. However I think we will just keep this one at the office and not have to bother with buying a new big one! It does only shred up to 6 pieces of paper however if you are like me and shred as you go this is really awesome! Otherwise I hate to say if you aren't like me and have a pile waiting for you to shred I wouldn't get this then. I would keep looking on amazon that can shred more pieces of paper at a time or how much it would hold the shred. Would highly recommend!

  I used this to shred 10 years of outdated tax documents, pay stubs, bills, etc. I was able to do all of this in under 30 minutes without any problems (the pile of papers was over 8 inches high). My prior shredder had an open metal mesh basket so it was easier to see when it needed to be emptied but it's a very minor inconvenience with this shredder. I like the auto function so it can remain on at all times. I've not had to cut up any credit cards yet so I haven't been able to test that functionality. I've had absolutely no issues with this shredder and I think it's a great value for the price.

  I bought this unit a little over a year ago. It worked fabulously for the first year, shredding whatever I slid into the slot: junk mail, cardboard, newspaper and all of the paper products in between. It was great to securely dispose of sensitive documents, and I assumed that the good times would roll forever.A few weeks ago it began to make an unusual noise. It had worked flawlessly to that point, so I knew that some thing off. I let it run for a while to see if the problem might resolve its self. It could have been a hidden jam, or any number of things. Eventually it became concerning enough that I decided to try the repair line.The first thing I learned is that you can not open the head of the machine at all. A sticker advertises that opening it will void the warranty, and it is also designed such that physically opening it will break the power supply. Lesson learned, lets see what customer service had to say.I was two months beyond the warranty period, so they could not offer a replacement. Great, so the shredder has a service life of exactly one year, and then it poops the bed. It still runs, but it struggles with self feeding and makes a very concerning jamming noise.I ran it on empty for a few minutes to see whether there was any obstruction in the blades, and there was none. I fed it a thin sheet, and the noise was definitely present, but not too bed. I fed it closer to its capacity, and the noise was only bad, but the shredder would just jam.That is how I learned that the gears that turn the blades were just jamming within the box housing. They would jam for a few seconds, and advance a few rotations. They would jam again, and repeat. Force feeding the paper through with slight pressure from the top made no difference. The gears were just breaking. There was no way to repair them, and there is no recourse after the warranty period.So there you have it from a man who has shredded with the best of them. This product seems great at first, but will not stand the test of time. Buy accordingly.

  No doubt this is a great shredder. It was delivered 8/30 and I started using it the first week of September. I went by the directions on shredding and filled it up(shredding for about 30 mins.) and getting ready to empty it, I noticed the top had had a lot of dust and when I poured it in to the trash the it was like emptying my fireplace ashes. This is when the table turns. Still not thinking about it I haven't used it since only because I have central heat and air, like most do. I started to see more than usual dust in my home. It was thicker and whiter. That 30 mins of shredding, the dust was being sucked up in my h&air unit. and circulating through my home. I started sneezing waking up with stuffy nose and I put 2 and 2 together. I will still use this little shredder but with a mask on and outside on my deck.

  Only time will tell how quiet it stays as the blades get duller. Right now I don't over work it and it works like a dream. The mechanics in the shredder portion seem hefty and powerful.The bad news-- only 3 stars for maneuverability because the weakest parts of the machine are the thickness of the shredder's catch-basket and the scoop-type handle to lift the shredder out of the basket. I would bet money that when this machine breaks it will be the basket or the handle--- and all to save a buck or so on the plastic. They should be thicker. The heavy duty shredders I owned or used before, had a lifting handle like one on a brief case. Lasted many, many years.

  I was a bit wary with the purchase of this document/credit card shredder since my other shredder was DOA when I finally got around to opening it 4 months after I received it.  Too late to return it.  That is what I get for setting an electrical appliance aside for so long.This shredder that I bought from Amazon is a hungry beast!  Never seems to get tired, and chops up plastic cards, stapled papers, thick envelopes, etc....The shredder easily devours  as many as 8 pages of material in one pass, but I will go easy on this baby.  Great cross-cutting little bits of paper.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

So whenever out shopping at the usual places would check the isle whrer they were sold and was shocked ... so when the pile of stuff to be shredded got too big got serious and logged onto Amazon and got this unit ... comparable units cost $25 -40 more at the brick and mrtor locations ... placed my order and two days later bingo I had received it ... works great smaller footprint than the old and noiser machine it replaced ... very pleased and would recommend for home or small office use. Oh, and the cross-cut is much better than the old strip cut from previous shredder.

  I've gotten great value from this shredder. It doesn't handle as thick of stacks as some of the higher end shredders, however for a majority of households, this is the perfect machine. It's light enough to move around anywhere in the house, but it's got the ability to be used daily and I've never had any issues. Would recommend this shredder to anyone.

It doesn't have any problems with cards or plastic envelop things. I had no problem shredding anything! It's a little loud, and my cats get very upset, but its not a big deal.Also when you don't have the shredder top on the bin, it won't shred which is great safety feature.I keep inviting my friends over to shred stuff but everyone suddenly claims they have their own shredder.

  It's my fault for putting a stapled set of pages that looked thin enough but I didn't count. I added a star but caution all to make sure not to put too many sheets in at once.It jammed, reverse sort of worked but the paper tore.  We've been picking small pieces out of the thing for days.  Also the plastic guide broke, see the photo. It runs freely in reverse but we can't trigger the forward (shredding). It's only a month old.It would be nice if we could open it up to clear the jam.I added a star because Amazon let me return it for a full refund.

  I will say that my shredder stopped shredding a little less than a year after purchase. I would use this every 2 weeks or so and even than, perhaps less. However, there is a one year warranty and amazon was pretty good. They are sending me a replacement right now and would like me to return the defective unit. However, I’m not sure what the life span is, since my original unit on light use didn’t even make it a year.

  Revision:Jammed up on 8 pages so badly it requires disassemblyDuring my time in the service, I used A LOT of shredders. There were times I thought that was my sole job. This one is a decent model for home use. It can handle most of those ""free"" credit cards envelopes unopened. If there is an included plastic card I would remove it and shred it separately.  Is does do cross-cut shredding. However, the shreds are about two inches. If you were a politician with something to hid this is not the shredder for you. On the other hand, if you just want to securely dispose of household sensitive paper this will suffice.I will update if it develops problems over time.

  I don’t trust tossing out bills or documents that have banking numbers or other personal information on them.  This cross-cutting shredder does the job quickly and perfectly.  Taking up to six sheets, its fast and not as noisy as most shredders I have owned or used.  It’s relatively small and fits conveniently under my desk at a height of only 15-inches.  The basket is large enough to last a few months before emptying is required.  I did overuse it, shredding several pages of documents at once and it did jam once.  The reverse button worked perfectly.  I also caused it to overheat once as well.  It simply stopped working.  I waited about ten minutes and after it cooled down, it was fine.  For the price, this is a great investment in your privacy.

  Not fair to write a detailed review of its function as I just tested it to see if it worked.  It did work but sound worries me as is sounds unlike previous shredders I've owned.  If it were a car I would suggest it has a bad spark plug. I'll assume it is ""normal"" for now.  It worked -but it did arrive ""broken"".  The first thing out of the box was the broken chip in first photo.  2nd photo was to document date, size and item, broken receptacle part.  3rd photo is where I believe the chip came from and 4th photo is of the chip with the head installed on the broken receptacle.  I attempted the automated return but both chat and phone were unavailable.  I don't have time to spend dealing with it unless it turns up not shredding well, but don't think it was a fair deal paying retail price for shredder with a (cosmetic) broken shredder receptacle.  Might have given 5 stars, but receiving broken things.... not like Amazon.

  It slices, it dices, it cuts up your documents into itty bitty pieces. So far so good, I wish the trash bin was a bit bigger but aside from that it works great. Credit cards were no problem at all. 6-8 pieces of paper at once are not a problem. It has an automatic paper eject feature in case something is too thick to be cut up. As a test I put a small magazine in it and it got about a quarter of the way before reversing back out. It also has a safety feature if the shredder is not placed on the bin correctly or if something (dog) knocks it over. You can keep it on continuous feed to keep the shred train going or just leave it in the auto position so that it will turn on as you put stuff in the shredder.

  I have had some recent concerns with information of mine being stolen out of our dumpster, and despite my efforts to conceal information with a privacy stamp roller, it just hasn't seemed to be enough so I invested in this shredder. I am so thankful I did. Not only is the price reasonable, the product itself is worth raving about. I love that it shreds in multiple ways, leaving pieces of paper impossible to retape or get information from. In addition it also shreds credit cards, and that's a huge bonus. Definitely worth the money, would recommend to anyone looking for a great paper shredder.

  After 15 minutes of use :  The IR sensor that detects the paper edge failed. The IR sensor enables automatic on-off while feeding sheets. Upon further review, the plastic anchoring features internal to the unit broke via stress cracking (lightweight design) and the IR sensors no longer aligned with each other and could no longer detect the paper as you feed it. I repaired locally (I'm the ToolGuy after all) and seems to be working.Regard this as a throw away item and you wont be disappointed.Pro: good entry level shredder if you have to leave the country fast for minor infractions . . . .(j/k)Con: look for a more robust mechanism next time

But, other that that, it works well.I had a decent amount of stuff to shred to start and spent a few hours over 3 days catching up.  This handled that pretty well.  Now I just shred as it comes in so it isn't being challenged much.Too much personal information is on so many of the credit offers and bills I receive.

It is now June 7th, 2018 and it has already quit working! We do NOT shred an enormous amount of paper. We watch what we run through it & how many pages. Yet in less than a year it’s not working. This is not a fluke. It is a poorly made shredder. We are Prime members & use Amazon on a very regular basis. I’m very disappointed in this Amazonbasics shredder.

  My previous (and rather elderly) shredder attempted to eat a metal dog tag - which got stuck in it's throat and caused it's demise.  I was getting tired of it anyway, as it was on the large size and quite heavy.  Because I use shredders only for my own personal documents, I figured that an inexpensive model would  be adequate and, since I've had general success with Amazon Basics items, I was happy to see this reasonably priced Amazon version.Been using it for long enough to feel secure in passing judgment - and it's definitely a five star product in my book.  For one thing, Its not as irritatingly noisy as my former shredder and for another, its more compact in size and much easier to empty and move around.  I'm a very small person and this sort of asset in office machines is very valuable to me.So all in all, A Really Good Deal at A Really Good Price....

  I was looking for a new micro shredder because I killed my old one. I love the micro shred the best. In any event, I did a bit of research to find one in a better price range than my old one because they typically only last a few years. I do A LOT of shredding. Anyway, this one was highly rated and the price point was good so I went for it. It works great but the added benefit is how quiet it is. I had no idea?! The only down side is it is a basket design. Meaning, you have to lift the shredder off of the basket to empty the basket. My old shredder was a pull out design. Oh well,  it is worth it for the quiet and the price.

  This is one of those shredders that tears the document up into little pieces as it shreds (since shredders that tear papers into strips can be put back together if thieves have the time and ambition).  Nobody will be putting your documents back together after this little guy is done with them!  It doesn't take a whole lot of paper at once, though - when it says you'll get like, six sheets in at once, you shouldn't push for any more than that, as you'll jam the shredder which could potentially break it.  At the very least, you'll jam it, which results in having to either pull the paper out (which damages the blades) or fight with it by reversing and forwarding the document until it's shredded up enough to come out.  The bin that comes with this shredder is slightly larger than the one I had for my old shredder, which is helpful if you're shredding a lot of documents at once, since you don't have to stop as often to change the bin.

  If you're not running a shady business where you need to shred 100's of documents a day... this is a winner. My use is 50-60 pages a week and it runs like a champ. I did have a day where I had several hundred pages to shred and it overheated, but that was an anomaly. Even then I just waited 20-30 minutes and I was good to go. 100% recommend for home business or home use.

  Bought this shredder to work off a big pile of old documents. It works really well and lasts a long time without over heating. We are careful in feeding the docs and even though it says it takes 12 pages at a time, I never fed through 12 pages because I want it to last! Overall, I am happy with the shredder, i just wish the bin has some sort of handle so we can lift the shredder more effectively as the motor portion is quite heavy but it doesn't affect the machine's ability to eat through papers effectively. I will recommend.

  This shredder is tiny, but mighty. I purchased it for regular home office use. It's light weight and very easy to use. I was a little skeptical. I was expecting a lower quality item considering the price, usually you get what you pay for. The instruction manual states that it is normal for the machine to become hot after a few straight minutes of shredding, so a red light will come on indicating you must stop shredding and allow the machine to cool for atleast fifteen minutes. My shredder became hot after about three straight minutes of shredding, but the light never came on and I'm not sure if it was defective or maybe I just didn't allow the machine to become hot enough to trigger the safety feature. I allowed it to cool promptly and continued shredding. I shredded hundreds of papers upon first use and all-in-all I think this was a great purchase.

  I purchased this paper shredded to shred cardboard for composting.  This shredder had one of the best price points which was important to me as I was unsure it would handle cardboard. I cup larger pieces down to about half the size of a standard writing paper and put these in one at a time.  Putting two pieces at ones, one on top of the other, likely would not fit.  The noise level is decent.  The machine is nowhere near silent but it does have a quieter hum than most of the cheaper office shredders I have used through the years at work.

  I purchased this as a used/open box model and it arrived in pristine condition.  Very easy to set up and use straight out of the box.  It's compact and easy to store, and the built-in handle to lift the shredder off of the basket is very convenient.  It's not light but its not so heavy that lifting the shredder to empty the basket would substitute for a gym workout.It worked very hard the first day and went into overheat mode a few times, which I expected since the big and small shredders I've used in the past will do this.  It also shreds single sheets of paper quickly and starts to strain a bit with more sheets, which is also what I expected.The strips are a bit wider than I expected but it's more than sufficient to destroy sensitive information.  Documents with standard 10 to 12 point fonts, as well as tinier 6 to 8 point fonts were shredded and the strips were unreadable.  The width of the paper insertion area is a bit narrower than other shredders I've used so I had to be more careful feeding the papers into it.  The unit also tips easily, since the shredder itself makes it top heavy.Overall, it's a good shredder for the money and it does what it's supposed to do.

  Bought this as a gift for a friend who just bought their first home.He has garbage and recycle service but was not comfortable putting his old bills and such in the trash.This shredder is a great basis shredder that will accept up to 6 sheets of paper. It cuts in a cross cut pattern instead of long strips, so much easier to destroy and not have someone try and piece back together your shreds.This also comes with a credit card shredder slot. SO you can safely and easily shred old debit and credit cards, with out the hassle of cutting them up with scissors.Easy to dump when the bottom container is full.Can run for 2 minutes continuously. Auto run and also reverse mode to clear any paper jams.Our friend is very satisfied. Great quality.Backed by Amazon's 1 year warranty and great pricepoint for this item.I purchased this item full price and was not compensated for my thoughts. I rely on product reviews just like others to help make my purchase decisions so I try each product very carefully before reviewing and always do my best to leave honest opinions  and provide as much facts as possible based solely on my experience.

  Basically, it somewhat does the job! Not sure how it got such high ratings?!  It's extremely small so don't bother looking at the picture, as they make it look like it's a normal size shredder! It's basically half the size as the standard one you'd find in a Walmart/Costco/Staples, etc.  I guess for $30 it's not so bad, if you will barely use it. It squeals constantly, even with 1 or 2 pages at a time. You can tell it struggles to crunch it all in there. This is definitely for home use! I would recommend it only for LIGHT DUTY or you will burn it out within a couple uses. As the pic shows, there are no wheels on it but it does have a reverse, so if anything gets stuck, you can send it back up and try it again! Overall, it's not the worst machine out there but for 20$ or more, you can buy a medium grade one that will last you longer! I say this because I was shredding a bill with envelop and it was struggling so (I'll stress this again...) you really can't shred too much in there!

  To say it takes 12 pieces of paper at a time is exaggerated. It was clogged in the first 15 minutes of use. This is much better for home use. It feeds slow so you waste your time feeding it. It was a challenge getting it to work again. I guess for the price it is what I expected. I probably gave it more stars than it deserves.

  I was looking forward to having a shredder like this. I didn't even use it until last month (missing the return window) and only put up to five pieces of paper in it at a time. I didn't even fill one bin before it stopped working completely. Complete waste of money! I will seek a better shredder from Costco. Save your money!

  If you receive lots of junk mail that needs to be shredded, this shredder works well. It is strong enough to shred through pretty much all mail left in its envelope, convenient and time saving for those mail items one knows does not deserve time and attention.In my experience, once this shredder gets beyond 10-12 sheets of paper, it starts to struggle a little bit, but splitting up the workload solves for this.Credit cards/membership cards shred well too. It shreds papers with paperclips and staples in them as well.Though this is not important to me, this shredder is pretty quiet.Capacity for items already shredded is fairly large, making long shredding sessions without multiple trips to the garbage and back to empty the shredder very doable.EDIT: I maintain my 4-star rating despite this unit failing in less than a year, reason being that I had several intense shredding sessions which pushed this unit went well-beyond its designed level of work. Years of shredding in just a couple weeks was enough to strip the plastic gear inside the unit, somewhat disappointing, yet having stress-tested this shredder to its breaking point, this is a great buy for this price.

  I've had this shredder for 3 years.  Its used about 4 times a year. It is oiled each time I use it.  Last week my television picture suddenly lost  signal.  No amount of moving the antennae made the picture come back in.  Then I  walked out of the living room and heard a weird grinding noise!  The paper shredder had started on its own and wouldn't shut off!  There was nothing in the shredder.  This was simply a malfunction.  A malfunction that  somehow affected the tv reception!  I pulled the plug on the shredder and the TV went back to normal!Scarey! I was so thankful I hadn't left the house that day as originally planned!  Something really bad could have happened if it had been able to continue grinding uncontrolled!

  Does not function or shred after less than 12 mos.  Operational green light is on, but the unit does not shred in forward or reverse. The motor does not start.  This is with very light, occasional usage....  After running cleaning/lubricating sheets through the unit and then using Fellowes oil through the unit,  I had a brief temporary fix. Worked for a short time.  Everything that has been tried does not fix the problem.  Maybe disassemble to see the problem???  Again, very light usage....  Cannot recommend this amazon basics item.

   Bought this specifically for the purpose of having a cross cut shredder but for a strip cut shredder instead. I don’t feel the documents I shred are as secure as I’d like but the strips are pretty small when they shred and the strip cut does make less of a mess when I empty the bin than cross cut shredders I’ve had in the past. I’ve had multiple cross cut shredders that were constantly jamming which hasn’t happened yet with this but I’ve only had it for about a month. I do use it pretty frequently and so far I have had a better experience with this than other shredders I’ve bought from retail vendors for twice the price! Definitely a great value but I will knock it down a bit for advertising cross cut when it’s strip cut. There are some things I like better with strip cut so I am pretty happy with this purchase

  I've used a whole bunch of different shredders from really big machines in the office that can go through a ream of paper in less than a minute, to other small machines for home use.  This is the first one I'd ever seen for $30, and it seemed like it'd be worth a shot.First off, it shreds really well.  Papers are shredded and cross-cut, so you get these little chunks that are nearly impossible to reassemble (in contrast to really old shredders that produced page-length pieces that *could* conceivably be put back together).  It works at a decent speed and is about as you'd expect a shredder to be:  louder than your air conditioner, but quieter than a powerdrill.It will seriously jam up if you put in too many sheets at once though.  I once put an entire envelope full of spam through this thing (so probably about 10 sheets total thickness) and it jammed and stopped.  Even reversing it couldn't fix the problem.  I had to unplug it and take the little bits out with tweezers to get it to start up again.

  Fork over the cash for the Jumboshred 3000 because you know you want this to shred the junk mail that has your name on it because you don't need people going through your trash to steal your identity. Unfortunately the junk mail folks know this already so they design their junk mail to get stuck in the puny 6-sheet shredder by stuffing their envelopes with 17-sheet-thickness nonsense so you have to open the junk mail to shred it it 3 equal portions of junk mail which defeats the purpose of the shredder anyway - to not have to be bothered with junk mail.But if you want to open the junk mail, separate the junk mail, and THEN shred the junk mail, have at it.

  When i saw the pricepoint of $65, i thought it would be a decent size.  Nope.  I don't think it even comes up to my knee.  A fair value for this is $39.99 at the MOST.  Anything higher than that and it's a waste of money.  Picture a 1 gallon milk jug.  The width is about 1 1/2 milk jugs.  If you factor in the slightly additional height, it probably holds about as 2 full milk gallon jugs, so not very much at all.  You're going to empty frequently.  I'm pretty pissed.  Don't buy it unless it's around that $39.99 pricepoint.

  I bought this shredder for home use.  I had used it once and it quit. I had thrown away the original box, so I felt I had no choice but to keep it. I brought it to work, a very handy co-worker fixed it. He told me that there were loose screws, and a broken piece at the feeder for the sheets of paper. I am not sure if it was handled roughly during shipping, or if it was faulty, but this was very disappointing.  I will certainly look for another shredder soon, but won't purchase this one again......not sure how long this one will last !!!

  This shredder has been in service for a month or so now with no problems whatsoever. It shreds into small strips that are nearly impossible to read. I have not used it to shred as many as 15 sheets, but it has handled four or five with no problem. The last shredder I bought from Amazon was also an AmazonBasics. I managed to burn it up very soon after purchase by running it for longer than the recommended time. I am being more careful with this shredder and don't expect to repeat the destruction of the previous purchase.

  I don't have high shredding needs -- I just need to shred some mail as it arrives.  When I first got this shredder I fed it a large bag full of papers, usually 2-3 pages at a time.  After about an hour of heavy use it didn't overheat, nor were there any jams.  Occasionally it struggled with several pages at once, but it didn't get stuck.  Since then I've just used it to shred up to a few pages as needed.  The other day it successfully shredded a credit card.  Overall, no problems, and I'm happy with the purchase.  Much, much better than keeping bags of sensitive documents lying around.The only bad thing is that the shredding isn't perfect.  It does cross-cut the paper, but the cross-cuts are rather large.  One of the shredded pieces was the perfect size to retain my full name.  But, certainly, this is better than nothing and would make it a pain for anyone to look through my mail.

  Actually, the shredder worked fine for 7 months. Then it stopped.  Since it was supposedly covered by a 1-year warranty, I tried to find out if it could be replaced or repaired under warranty.  That's when things got complicated.I had a horrible time getting info on the warranty,  but when I finally got the right person, he sent me a new one with virtually no questions ask.The shredder is ok.  I wouldn't shred 12 sheet at a time though.  But the service was wonderful.

  We received this damaged and could never reach Amazon to for Replacement or Refund. Second damaged one I received. The problems are that the circuit board under the slider control had 3 of 4 mounts broken and hanging by just one screw, so that the slider wouldn't even touch the switch underneath. The board was also damaged. Under the shredder, the paper level sensor had one side broken and the ""flapper"" would fall into the shredder basin. 2nd review hopefully to Amazons standards now. Do not buy this product.

  First unit that was purchased was defective and jammed up almost immediately. Blades did not appear to be cutting properly. Fortunately Amazon's return service is excellent and we got a replacement that works perfectly. Been shredding reliably at specifications for a while now, and I have no complaints. In short, it does what it says it does... provided you don't get a bad unit. The quality control seems to be a bit dodgy and so your odds of getting a bad unit are low but present. If you need to have a 100% reliable shredder out of the box immediately, pass on this shredder. If you don't mind dealing with a potential return, this gives you a very competent shredder for the money.

  We have had this shredder for about two and half years.  A few months ago it would not shut off after use on the auto setting unless we turned it off.  I cleaned the sensors several times as stated in the troubleshooting guide and it would work for a few days and then start again, even turning itself on when not in use.  A few days ago I came back from walking the dogs and I smelled something burning.  I could hear the shredder running in the office and saw smoke coming from unit.  I unplugged it and put it in the trash.  I honestly believe this thing would have caught fire had I not found it in time.  I was gone less than an hour, and can't believe the damage this could have caused.

  I can't say this is the best shredder I have ever used but it does a really good job for our home office needs, which are frequent but not great in quantity. We usually have a few pages to shred here and there. It eats right through staples which saves time from having to remove staples. And it is the right price for a decent shredder - very happy with this purchase.

  Honestly, the only reason I purchased this was because I just recently got a composter and wanted to be able to shred cardboard and other compost safe materials. I searched around and decided that I didn't want to spend a whole ton of money and saw a review from another purchaser who uses this to shred cardboard for compost as well. This is perfect for what I intended it to be used for and has an overheating warning light (which is great because otherwise I'd just keep going and bust it). Small size means I can plug it in next to my trash and recycle bins in the kitchen and it doesn't get in the way.

  It was definitely hard to decide what shredder to get. Trying to stay inexpensive but also get a nice quality product that works and will continue to work for a while. Then I found this gem in my search, and after reading specs and of course reviews, I went ahead and purchased this one. We love it!! Works very good, quick, not very loud and has some great safety measures so I feel comfortable having this one in our household where there are little ones running around ( though I still unplug when not in use) very happy with my purchase. Great quality product! Thanks Amazon!

  My order arrived quickly and there was zero assembly, other than adding the shredder to the can.  I started using right away, shredding tax documents.  I removed the paper clips and staples (even though the directions said that it wasn't  necessary).  The model I bought claimed that you could shred 8 regular sheets of paper at a time.  I never exceeded 3/4 pages at a time.  The shredder clogged up within about 15 minutes of shredding.  I tried the troubleshooting recommendations of reversing to unclog, which didn't work.  After trying to reverse and forward a few times, the teeth on the gear were stripped and the machine could not be used.  my husband took apart the shredder and removed all the clogged paper and put it back together again.  It still would not work, since the gear was stripped.  I realize that you get what you pay for and this was not an expensive shredder; however, I thought it would work for my small shredding jobs.  Money down the drain.

  Was looking for casual home use, the occasional spam letter. Thought the cheaper option would be fine.Received the shredder, and it did not work at all, the motor did not spin, and I could not even tell if it was getting power. I requested a replacement, and then the exact thing happened, no motor from the beginning. Checked the instructions to make sure i was not an idiot. and everything was set up correctly.I had to go out of my way to return the package at the amazon book store, when the replacement came and did not work the book store would not accept it, and i had to return it at the distribution center.Just a poor experience all around.Spend a little more money and get a quality product.

  After only light use, this top-rated (why???) machine jams up, reverse mode doesn't clear the problem, picking away with tweezers to get every last shred out doesn't fix the problem either (after unplugging, or course!), etc.  The first time I figured it was us, so we foolishly re-bought the same machine.  Same problem even after using only 3-4 sheets of paper consistently.  I don't get why this shredder is so highly rated.  We could not have been more careful in using it!

  I purchased one of these last Summer and it worked really well at first, so I decided to buy another one to put in another room in December. Well, in less than 2 months, the one I purchased in December broke and would not shred. A week later, the one I purchased in June (about 8-9 months ago) quit working as well. We don't shred a lot of paper, just junk mail that has our personal information on it which we always open up and only put 2-3 sheets at a time, so usage is light. Perhaps we received defective ones, but I would not recommend.

  We live in a rural area and generally had just burnt our paper trash.  However, my wife began a project for composting and this shredder is perfect for reducing the sheets of paper to a form excellent for composting.Is sits beside my computer station and now I wonder how I did without it.  The only minor negative is that paper tends to stick to the blades, so I use a needle nosed pliers to remove the debrit every time I empty the shredder into a plastic bag.  Very satisfied.

  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for, at a fraction of the cost charged at some of the bigger box stores! The packaging it was delivered in was relatively compact. It is not too noisy, much quieter than the single strip shredder it is replacing. I've killed a few shredders in the past, but none of them had an auto-shut off function to prevent overheating of the electric motor that prevented it from burning out. Shredding 6 sheets at a time is not a big deal for the small office set up I currently have. So far, it easily shreds unopened junk mail from businesses soliciting their credit card offers with my name and address on the envelope. I have used the credit card shredding slot and I find it helpful, knowing there is a different blade arrangement in the shredder unit intended only for plastic, and I don't have to worry about dulling the paper-cutting blades prematurely. The container is small and fits inconspicuously beneath my desk.I am sure with occasional lubrication with of hair clipper oil, vegetable oil, or whatever lubricant they recommended, I can get a good 5 years of use from this before it would have to be replaced again. That would be an excellent ROI for this productIn summary, great value for the dollar. The Amazon brand of products is comparable to Mailmate and Fellows brands for similar product, at a fraction of the brand-name cost.

  In preparing for a move, we came across more than 20 years worth of medical and financial documents that we didn't want to just toss to the curb.  They needed to be destroyed.  I burned out my old shredder in under 30 minutes, so it was time to buy something new & more powerful.  This shredder is a little pricier than what I'd normally but, but when I was looking at spending $1 a pound for a shredding service and we had more than 70 lbs of paper, this was the way to go.The new shredder arrived this afternoon, and this afternoon/evening alone I managed to fill 5 trash can liners! That's a lot of paper. This thing is a beast and didn't overheat once.So whether you need a shredder to properly destroy decades of personal information, or you need one for your business, or you want one for occasional use at home, I highly recommend this one from Amazon.

  I've had this for a little over a year and everything has ran pretty well until recently.The sensor that detects paper has started to stay on so even after the paper is fed through it it stays on.  I've thoroughly cleaned the machine and used the lubricating sheets to hopefully save it and it started working again.But here's the BAD part.... I left it on Auto mode like normal. Come home one day and hear this really weird noise echoing through my house.  I follow the sound to my office to smell a hot electronics smell and to find this paper shredder just running constantly.  The plastic body was really warm almost hot and I have no idea how long it had been running....If you have an AUTO setting then there HAS to be safety precautions in place to auto shutoff after running non stop for that long.I'm just happy it didn't cause any further problems which it easily could've done.

  I recently tossed a very basic 'Achiever' paper shredder.  It worked, but could only do a few papers at a time.  After it broke, I resolved to get a new paper shredder, and ended up choosing this one.My concern was that I was underspending what I should on a paper shredder, and this $35 one would be too much of a compromise.  I wanted a shredder that I could just feed a whole bulk mail envelope to, without having to open it, and I was pleasantly suprised that it did a great job of destroying entire unopened envelopes.This may not sound like much of an achievement vs 17 paper office space shredders, but in my opinion this was unexpectedly great especially for the price.  The wheels on the bottom of the shredder look powerful and effective, it  comes with a stylish looking paper bin, the instructions are simple and effective, and it is able to automatically shut itself down in the event of an overheat.I'm really happy with this purchase, and look forward to destroying a bunch of documents.

  This shredder cannot handle more than a couple of sheets at a time.  This will prolong your shredding project exponentially.  It may be better to buy a more expensive model that actually allows more than 1-2 pages.  Amazon needs to revise the description - eight pages will invariably overheat the shredder, and then you have to wait 20-30 minutes.  I have had jams with four pieces of regular grade paper and no longer use this product for ""big"" shredding projects.  If you only shred a few documents a month, you will be fine.

  The description of this unit is NOT accurate.You can easily see in the photo  that this shredder cuts the paper into 'strips' instead of small 'cross-cut'  'bits and pieces. like I had expected (and wanted).My 'old' shredder did the 'strip shredding' and those strips continued to get 'jammed' up in the grinding mechanism.. Because of that, I ordered this unit based on its description because I wanted a true 'cross-cut unit to avoid that jamming from happening.

  We really like this shredder.  It will shred credit cards...  no problem.  It shuts off automatically whenever the shred bin is full.  My only complaint is that it gets a little messy when we pull out the full shred bin.  This may be due to the fact that I will shake the paper down (to settle it) in order to fill it a bit more, so take that into consideration.  I really like this shredder and we would purchase it again.

  So it over heated 20 minutes into using it. Note if it glows red then wait 30 minutes for it to cool down. I knew I had a lot to shred, but I didn't know it would give up so quickly. If I were a smarter man, I should have listened to my gut and purchased the one with the stronger motor. I'm ok with this model. once the shredding is over. I intend to clean my office with great vigor and haste. I haven't seen my table tops in months.

  I bought this shredder to replace a slightly cheaper Gear Head shredder Model # PS580SC that broke down when I put an envelope with the clear plastic window in it. It froze and would not work again in forward...works in reverse but that didn't fix the problem. I only had that one a few months, would never go that route again Also when I look at the thick blades on this compared to the thin flimsy blades on the Gear Head model it's like night and day. Also this one cuts both ways as opposed to the Gears Head slicing long stings of paper It is worth the money and saved me from having to cut all my bills and business letters with my name, address and account numbers on them with a pair of scissors. Had stacks of envelopes piled on my dining room table that I was afraid to throw in the trash until I got this. No more clutter.

  January 3rd, 2019.  Again editing the review. The shredder now continues to behave itself, and I am once again happy with it!!  It may have been a faulty outlet on my end all along.  Upping it to 4 stars!!Previous:  I'm editing this review.  I received the return shipping label from Amazon.  Was about to put the unit in a box for return, when I thought one more time, I would try to unplug and plug back in.  It worked this time!!  The green light is on!  It's shredding.  Hmm, after reading other reviews, not sure how long this baby will really live for, so I am wary, and am hanging on to the box!!  (Just changed from 1 to 3 stars).Earlier review:  I've had this shredder for 6 months.  I loved it until just the other day, when I asked it to shred about 25 pieces of paper, with no more than 3 pieces in the shredder at one time.  When I was finished, the green light went off, and it hasn't worked since.  If it did overheat, the red overheat button never went on, there was no indication that it overheated.  I went through troubleshooting, nothing worked.  I've called Amazon, and they were very helpful.  They gave me the option to have a new one shipped to me, or send it back (they sent a mailing label), and receive a refund.  I opted to get a refund, and shop for a new one.  I am very happy with Amazon's service, but am disappointed with the product.  Don't buy this product.

  Almost never jams. Reasonable workhouse for household paper shredding.  Goes through credit cards easily.  My only complaint is how easily it tips over and what a mess it makes when it does.  The heavy shredder/motor is all on the top with a light-weight portion that holds the paper at the bottom.  That's pretty typical. But I store it under my desk and it seems like the slightest bump with my foot tips it over, knocks the top off and dumps paper shreddings all over.  Seems like a more heavy bottom or an ability to latch the top on would prevent the spilling of small paper pieces.

   Came in today, so I tried it immediately. In the video is a piece of the box it was shipped in and killed it just fine. I also tried a piece of pizza box (too wide so I had to cut it in half).  I tried a bank statement that was still sealed in the envelope and no problem with that either. All in all seems like a good shredder- but it's just day one.Noise level, it sort of sounds like it has a blower attached to it lol, but whatever. My dog wasn't scared of it at all and she's terrified of the vacuum, so it cant be that bad.So far, I'd recommend.

  I purposely do not write reviews immediately after product receipt as I do not believe it is a true representation of product quality and more of a sellers review than a product review.  So here is my review of this paper shredder after owning it for over two years.  The product has performed beautifully shredding papers in varying thicknesses from old gift cards to junk mail (still in the envelope) for the past couple of years.  Using the shredder several times a week over two years you think would just wear it out.  Not this shredder.  It still is shredding papers, cards, envelopes of mail like the day I plugged it in.  I still have not had to grease or oil anything since owning it.  I would highly recommend this shredder to family members and friends if they were in the market for a good quality paper shredder.  My partner has not even managed to burn this one out like the previous 2-3 we had which lasted far shorter than this shredder...and that's saying something!

  It works OK.  Paper basket is not very large.  Much less power/speed than our previous (bigger) shredder.Have not tried large number of pages.  Just a few pages slows it down, a lot.The basket fills up pretty quickly.  But, not a show stopper.Wish I'd read dimensions more carefully.Most shredders are finicky.Use a lubricant.

  It's been a looong time since I had a shredder. As a result I had piled up a lot of paper to shred. Right out of the box, I went through my pile of old papers that needed to go away. I shredded for probably an hour straight. It kept right on going making little paper bits. Noise level was fine.This is a 15 sheet shredder. I'd say that's pushing it as it would bog down and get slow on 12 sheets. Probably a bigger motor would solve that. I bet if I shredded 15 sheets 6 or 8 times in a row the temperature sensor would kick off. It's more realistically a 12 sheet shredder with some amount of slowing down. 15 sheets slows down a lot.

  This is exactly what I needed. I’ve been storing papers for quite a few years because of my fear of someone getting my personal info if I just threw them away or ripped them by hand. Since I had to start working remotely and have to handle others personal info as well, I decided to buy this shredder. It works great. I use it daily and it gets the job done. I’ve had it a few months now and it seems pretty strong. I buy little plastic trash bags from the dollar store and it catches the paper and makes clean-up easier. I recommend if you’re in need.

  As of today, a month after I purchased this.... it will not turn on, no power is provided thru cord plugged in.  As of April 4th I cannot return it.  Says it is under warranty for a year, but is no way offered to contact anyone for help in replacement or repair.  I find this often that purchasing on Amazon the window or guided method to contact manufacturer etc is not offered.  It it quits, as mine has, I guess it is just money wasted as I see no way to contact the seller..

  So far, so good. Seems like a decent little shredder. Its not really little, its a perfect size, like a small trashcan. You can fit a grocery bag in there so it catches all your shredded paper and its much easier to just take he bag out when its full. My last one I could not do that and had papers everywhere trying to empty it. This is compact, but big enough for what I need it for, just the usual bills and sometimes junk mail. Its small enough to put just about anywhere. Mine fits under one of my kitchen cabinets, so its out of sight and out of the way, yet in a handy spot. You just pick up the top piece, take out your bag, put in another and your all set. So easy!!  I used to have a much bigger one that quit on me., but I really prefer the smaller size. Its been working great so far, but I don't over fill it or anything. Only a couple sheets at a time, even though t says it will take 6. Nice and easy does it everytime!!  Great Product from Amazon

  I've put this shredder through the wringer (ha...) and it does well. It's a home shredder, suitable for one or two people's occasional needs, not a office machine, but it does what it's supposed to do, and quite well, at a good price.If you run it continuously for several minutes it WILL shut down and need a cool down period of a good half-hour. It can handle several sheets for maybe two minutes without running into that. Don't expect to shred a large pile of papers in one sitting.It also handles credit cards well, and chews through staples without any trouble, so you don't have to carefully remove all of them.I'm quite happy with it.

  I love this shredder. I had read a couple of reviews where people had trouble with the bin, but it hasn't been a problem at all. I've had other shredders where I felt like all I did was empty the bin. This one has adequate space so I can shred a lot before I have to empty it. It's reasonabley quiet and it hasn't balked at shredding unopened envelopes - my primary purpose for it. Don't we all get a ton of mail we really don't want to open, but it's the only way to get at that personal information that we want destroyed - this does just what I wanted and at a very reasonable price.

  They say that it's an 8 page shredder, but it's really about a 5 to 6 page shredder, based on the sound the motor makes, as you add more sheets. The final shred product is pretty good.It's not really a heavy duty shredder, but really a medium duty personal shredder.But hey, for sixty bucks, you need to be a little patient.

  After one year, this shredder ""up and died"" after a 30-minute shredding session. I didn't shred more than 6 sheets at a time and put credit cards into the defined credit card slot. The bin wasn't full, either. It just overheated, jammed, and gave up the ghost all at once. Shredders seem like pretty delicate machines in general. I've never met a shredder that didn't tap out at the slightest provocation, so I'm not sure what to buy now. I don't want to spend $160+ on a heavy duty version that might also fail. At this point, I'm open to suggestions and wondering where to find a good paper shredder repair company.

  I can’t believe I bought this two years ago in 2016 and it still working and cuts beautifully ..... I don’t remember if I already did a review or not but this unit is definitely worth the money and made well... this is not a compensated review .....oh,  and as far as the noise for goodness sakes,  it’s got to be a little noisy but how long do you really sit there and shred .... and let me tell you I have sat there shredding papers from my filing cabinet that I no longer needed and I sat there and shredded until it gave me the notice that the unit was hot.... so that is a very good safety feature ...... only thing I worry about is are they making the units as good as they did two years ago ?

  I was skeptical at first based on similarity of design with my present shredder I'd had for quite some time and it crapped out on me  due to a faulty slide switch like the one this machine has  but your staff persisted  and convinced me to try it based on good reviews for this product and I'm glad I bought it . Product simplicity of design with a stout heart I highly recommend this machine to all you fellow skeptics out there who've been burned before. I think this purchase will change your attitudes for the better. Thanks Amazon Customer service staff (you know who you are)for your encouragement.

  This shredder worked perfectly.  I was very impressed with the number of sheets it could take at once with no problem.  My only suggestion would be to put the on/off switch on the top of the unit because it is sometimes difficult to locate it unless you stand up and look on the back side.  Other than that, very happy with this product.

  When my wife and I moved we had boxes of bills, forms, and sensitive documents. We both have shredders at work but didn't want to haul all of our shred-worthy documents to work and fill up our works' shredders a few times. We filled up two large garbage bags over the course of a days worth of shredding and the thing still works like a champ. I had some mechanical oil that I used to grease the shredder after emptying the bin (every other time).This DOES NOT MAKE CONFETTI, but good luck piecing together the cross-cut pieces that it produces. We ran a handful of cards through it, and it seemed to handle them just fine. After shredding ~200 documents in a row the unit got pretty warm to the touch so we gave it a break. The ""overheat"" light never turned on, but I didn't want to risk damaging it.After the marathon we put it through it still works great. I have had it for ~five months now and have not had any problems. I continue to oil it every time I empty the bin, I would strongly recommend doing the same.

  At first look, and first tries, right out of the box, this shredder is impressive. It's also MUCH LESS expensive than Royal, Fellowes and Bonsaii, at equal paper capacity. However, with the recent electrical issues with Amazon Basics equipment, we may need a little more time to evaluate. It is quiet, tears through paper and allows you to see the result via the window on the bin. The ONLY negative so far is the fact that it goes immediately to ""Power On"" when plugged in. From a safety standpoint, we'd rather see it that you have to actually push the power button to go directly to ""Power On"". In our Law Office, each employee has their own shredder, so we do not need anything more than an 18-sheet capacity. We also like the 30 minutes on / 10 minutes off run time and thermal protection. If we have issues in the future, you can bet that we'll modify the review.  With 66,470 ratings and only 6% being negative, it paints a pretty good picture.

  This little shredder has stood the test of an apartment full of shreddables (junk mail, college readings/handouts, receipts, etc) and handled it all quite well! I've had it since May of this year, and it held up despite the onslaught of paper. It shreds wonderfully, although you have to be careful with how much you put in once - the shredder really bogs down when you put too much/too thick of a paper/packet/envelope in.I love how the lid/shredder will not activate unless the lid/shredder is firmly on the base basket; I don't have to worry about losing my fingers when cleaning it!I recommend putting a liner in the basket; it makes it easier to clean. Otherwise, the basket is covered in paper dust. I also recommend shredding everything bluntly: text on document should be horizontal with shredder when inserting. Otherwise, you could end up with strips that have more readable text visible than you'd like.

  Shredder does what it's supposed to do.  However, I came home from work one day and found this thing running on its own (no paper had been fed through).  My entire house smelled of burnt plastic; the unit was too hot to touch, and still running.  Luckily, nothing caught fire.  I left it in the off position from that point on and only switched it to auto to shred papers, because it still functioned.  Although the price was decent, I won't buy this unit again when it's time to purchase a new one.

  We bought one of these, and within a week or so of moderate use, it stopped working. It said it was overloaded but there was no paper in it. Amazon replaced it and the 2nd one was very clearly USED. It had shredded paper in the basket as well as in the blades itself - there was even paper ready to be shredded in the blades.  There was an oily  wipe across the 'clear' window on the basket. Then itstopped after 2 days of moderate use with the same problem, except this time there was 12 pages to be shredded and they were hung in the shredder. These were very disappointing because we wanted so badly for these to work.

  Works fine.  I DO wish it had some kind of handle on or towards the bottom.  Emptying the shredded paper into a plastic waste bag is an exercise in the physics of vaccum, but nobody else has attached a handle either.  I like the see-through panel very much.  Great for home or home/office personal use, not for regular use in a big office.  The reverse feature works fine too.  I've found that 3 sheets back-to-back at once is as much as I want to put through it at a time - otherwise you can hear it laboring.  Not a bad idea to get the sharpening paper/pads with it. I've used those primarily for cleaning before I put the machine away for a while (keep the great box for that).

  I've had this shredder 5 years and it's still going strong. The only issue I've had with it was the auto-stop feature recently stopped working. So I took it outside and blew it out with compressed air (which resolved the issue) and and used white graphite grease the cutter heads. I'm thinking the white dust from the shredded paper had built up on the paper sensor and made the shredded think it still needed to shred. I like this shredder and would highly recommend it.

  This shredder seems to work well. It does not however cut documents up small enough for real privacy. Some letters or documents can still be read pretty clearly after shredding.

  Absolutely brilliant, simple paper shredder. 10/10 would buy again. AmazonBasics always have above average/basic products, kind of more like Amazon'sAmazingBasics. It starts to over heat if you use it constantly for like 45 minutes to 1 hour. Although, if it does begin to overheat, it stops and needs about 24 hours to start again, which is a great safety feature to protect the machine. The cutters are extremely sharp and I haven't experienced any tangled up shreds of paper. It is the cross-cut design and only that. It fits perfectly in the bin. It's extremely safe in that it won't work if the top is taken off the bottom bin. It shreds credit cards nicely.Provides a level of security that is above other shredders.10/10 would buy again.

  This is the second one of these shredders that I’ve had. The first one crapped out after just 15 minutes of use so I sent it back. So far, this one is holding up okay (fingers crossed). I was hoping it would be a finer crosscut.This is an updated review: After only 2 months of occasional use, this shredder has also crapped out and quit. DO NOT BUY! You would think that any product that Amazon would put its name on would be credible, but not so! This is pure junk and I can’t get a refund because the return window has closed!

  It's notable that most of the positive reviews for this item are from folks who've recently purchased it. Whereas if you read the 1-star reviews, you'll find that a chunk of people who've had the item for several months or a year find that it just stops working even if they've rarely used it. That was the case for me. I used the shredder over a 2 year period so infrequently (and never more than one sheet at a time) that I only had the plastic bag fill up 3-4 times. It mostly sat quietly under the desk. Yet the other day I went to shred a page and suddenly nothing. The motor works in *backwards* mode,  i.e. if you're trying to unjam a piece of paper, but is completely dead in the forward shred mode.  Now I see that a good 12 percent of the reviews are 1- or 2-star and that lots of people have had the same problem. Amazon should be ashamed to put its name on a product that has such a consistent and high fail rate and that, according to some people, can also be a fire hazard. After having the machine more than a year, there's no chance of getting my money back since it apparently only has a 1-year warranty.  But I would certainly think twice before buying any ""Amazon Basics"" item again -- they obviously mean it ""basically"" works for just a short while.

  Same issue as everyone else. I barely used this, perhaps a few sheets of paper every couple of months. After exactly a year of minor use it just stopped working for no reason. Green power light is on, the reverse works but when I put a piece of Paper against it to shred, nothing!Seems like this is a pattern amongst most reviewers. 1 year usage only then stops, waste of money!

  9/12/19 Update: this is the 2nd unit after Amazon replaced the first one that failed within 6 months. This one has now failed just shy of 2 months. Just randomly stopped working. No warning on either failure, just went to use it and... dead as a doornail. Checked power, toggled the switch a few times, made sure there were no clogs. That is with regular oiling and changing the basket when 90% full.  Needless to say I will ask for my money back and buy a unit that will last.Orginal Review: Great price and exactly what we needed in a home shredder. It's not micro, but it cuts it up good enough to frustrate any would-be identity thieves tempted to rummage through the trash, lol

  It's adequate for basic home use, but after a year it started to run continuously even when not in use. It's quite loud so imagine hearing this loud machine kick on in the middle of the night when no one is in the room! Now I have to turn it off when I'm not using it and in between stacks because it will overheat very fast. And I'm sure it's not an electrical problem in my house that caused this because it's plugged into a safety power strip and none of the other devices or electronics have malfunctioned.

  This is a great shredder for smaller jobs.  It handled shredding thicker items like old credit cards and drivers's licenses with no problem at all.  Make sure to follow the instructions.  Allow your shredder to rest periodically.  If you continuously shred without allowing the shredder to settle, it will overheat and its internal safety mechanism will shut off the shredder temporarily.  I was shredding for an entire evening and there were times when I pushed my luck by putting more paper through than I should've, or fed paper through faster than I should've.  As a result, the shredder became jammed or overheat.  I just followed the instructions to feed an index card through to un-jam it and that advice worked great.  Save the instructions for sure.

  I bought this for personal/home use and I think, it quiet perfect for its purpose. As I expected for the price itself, it will not do tons of work like when you are at the office and require a lot of work and effort. This is best for simple, easy personal home use only. The only thing I don't about this is it stop like a few minutes of shredding papers, not with what the instruction says. Like literally, I need to stop every 5 minutes to cool-off which is a pain if u want to finish the job done right away. Like every school year end, I need to throw a lot of stuff from my kids school - tons of papers that we no longer needed. And few of those I want to be shredded and not just throw away so, I decided to get a cheap one like this just fr our home use. It works perfectly fine with the shredding thing but if you are impatient with time and waiting, well then... this is not the best option for you. We will upgrade as soon as we have enough money, buy a pricey but more doable for all of us. For little use, this will works out fine!

  I purchased this paper shredder so I could shred personal documents I did not want to just throw away. The machine works very well! I shredded several papers at a time and was even able to shred old checkbooks after ripping them in half to fit into the machine. The shredder is quite loud but I am not bothered by the noise. The trash container is about a foot in size but only fills up about 3/4 the way before the safety in the machine prevents any more shredding until the trash is emptied. It is definitely not meant for someone who is shredding several papers every single day because of the size of the bin. However, it's perfect for the home to shred the occasional document or credit card.

  I tested it a bit with different types of paper, and it seemed to work fine.  The motor sounds pretty powerful, almost like there some cooling fan running with it.  So far the only thing I don't like is the on/off switch.  It seems pretty flimsy and feels like it could break anytime.  Whoever designed it could have done a better job on this switch.  Anther thing I noticed is the delay of the paper feeding sensor.  Once you put some paper into the slot, it takes 2-3 seconds before the motor starts running to pull paper in.  That's just a bit annoying (compared to the one I had before this one, which started right away).  But the switch is the main flaw.

  It sometimes struggles even with as few as two sheets.  When single or multiple sheets get twisted and don't feed directly perpendicular the unit bogs down terribly.  It really should be listed as a 2-3 sheet shredder.  In addition it takes about 5 seconds to complete an 8.5 x 11 sheet.  So plan on spending some time if you are shredding something that takes multiple feeds.On the positive it shreds into pieces about 1/4"" by 1 1/2"" which is much better than a strip shredder because in addition to added security, more sheets can fill the bin before needing to empty.  It looks nice - not too small or too large for home use.Overall I'm fine with it for occasional use for bank statements, bills, etc., but wouldn't want to try shredding large file folder as it would take a very long time.

  It shreds your documents and doesn't complain until you pull out the box you've been hoarding for 6 months.It overheats when you are doing marathon shredding sessions. It jams when you try to put too many pages through at once, but that is why they have multiple models with varying shred-power.If you're serious about your shredding and you tend to stockpile for a while before you deal with it, I would recommend purchasing a more powerful model. Otherwise, if you're patient or do a small amount of shredding, and don't need the highest level of security, you'd be hard pressed to come up with complaints about this thing.One thing before I go: I would recommend emptying it before it gets too full if you want to avoid tiny pieces of paper all over the place.

  Generally satisfied with this. It's lighter than my old shredder, and it's easier to empty a full basket without making a mess. One complaint, which resulted in four rather than five stars: the ""Off"" setting is in the middle position, between the ""feed"" and the ""reverse"" buttons, which is a bit of a nuisance because you're always pushing past the ""Off"" position to one of the others. Recommendation to Amazon: move the ""Off"" setting either to the far right or far left. Just a reminder if you're looking at this one: it's a crosscut, not a microcut. Overall, it does the job in a no-nonsense manner.

  I bought this unit 2 years ago since I gave away my fellows shredder which was at least 5 years old (the unit was still working but I figured I should buy the new one and give the old one away).  that decision came to bite me back a few days ago since the amazon shredder just stopped working.  we use it about twice a month to shred junk mail and bills for the most part (maybe a credit card or 2 once a year).  it seemed like a good value at 1st but for a unit that lasted for just 2 years, I should've opted paying a few more dollars for another fellows shredder (which I ended up doing a few mins ago).

  This item would be perfect if it didn’t smell after the paper would shred, although I am not sure if it’s the type of paper being shredded. 🤔 even more important my item came with an undamaged box but a damaged product. I was hesitant to order this from amazon and I wish I would not have. I am very particular about items so if I didn’t absolutely need it I would return. When I opened the box it was just simply not packed well, which led to the plastic screen in the middle being severely cracked.

  I like the fact that it shreds well. It's not quiet but what shredder is? Safety features are great!  If you pick up the part that shreds, it will stop until you put it back on the bin. My only suggestion, if you are shredding anything that's sticky like, a shipping address sticker for example, make sure to put either part of a regular sheet of paper on the sticky part or, fold the ""sticker"" so the none of the sticky part will make contact with the blades of the shredder. It's a little hard to clean out but it can be done.

  I was in the market for a paper shredder, but didn't want to spend a fortune. I was hesitant to purchase this one given some of the reviews, but I have been using it for about 6 months now and couldn't be happier with my purchase! When you first receive the shredder there is a note inside stating the product was tested and may contain paper residue- No, they did not send you an old used product!! I use this to shred all of my old bills and my kids love shredding all of their old school papers and whatever junk mail they can find!  It is used daily and still runs great! The bin is a little small, but it still holds a nice amount and  is very easy to empty.

  This has been a great purchase so far. I haven't used it enough to know if it will stand the test of time but so far it has been relatively quiet (all shredders are loud so this ones decent) and it is really easy to use. Would have loved a small bottle of oil to come with as it did not and I wanted to use right away without concern of messing up any mechanisms. It has the standard safety feature of of not turning on if the lid isn't placed properly which is great. Also won't work if there is a bag of any kind in it which is okay if it means its safer. Great purchase overall.

  I had a 12 sheet shredder that died and decided to try this one. I did have a large batch to shred, but after some time got it all done (overheats after about 3-4 minutes of constant use). Letting the machine cool down for 30 minutes has it ready to go again. Most of the time I shred a couple of pieces at a time and this unit is perfect for that. If you have regular heavy loads of shredding, then this unit will not be adequate.The unit does have a window to see how much is in the bin. You do have to take the whole head off (handle to do it) to empty the unit which is why I took one star off.

  There are so many different models, prices, and brands it can get really confusing when trying to make a purchase decision. I studied reviews, prices, features, and brands for several hours and became more confused the more I read. I decided to keep it simple and look at the basics. I finally found this shredder from amazon basics. I like the $29 price and the features seemed adequate for out use. I placed the order and when we got it via ups 2 days later (prime member) we were impressed with the quality, efficiency, and low noise compared to others we’ve had in the past. I can’t think of anyway to beat the value and quality of this shredder. We’d highly recommend it to the home user who just needs the basic features and a high quality product. Great job amazon!!

  I use this device infrequently and lightly (few papers) and have had it 1.5 years.  I like to keep it set on AUTO.  Recently, it will randomly kick on although I've put no papers into it.  It will then continue to run for a few minutes.  In an attempt to prevent this from recurring, I've cleaned out the inside, but it still happens.  I cannot find the devices that recognize the presence of inserted papers.  If I had ready access to them, I would try to clean them in an attempt to prevent the random kick-ons.  I don't want to take the machine apart.

  I bought this after I moving across country to my new house.  I had it for a week before taking it out of the box.  My mom was helping me put stuff away and thought she was helping by getting rid of the box.  I went to use it and the damn thing doesn’t work!  No juice.  I have checked everything and it will not turn on.  I’m really bummed out as I can’t return it without the box.  Buyers beware, this thing is cheap with a capital C!  It doesn’t deserve one start, a complete waste of money, ugh!

  This schedder is due to it's size easier to move about and store. While the unit is smaller than other shredders, it allows for a good amount of shredded paper. The cross cut feature makes for a more secure disposal of sensetive material. Also the 8 page capacity helps to allow for less time spent shredding. And for all these plus features the cost is quite favorable. So if you need to do medium amounts of shredding, are limited in space and wish to not take a long time to do this some ""boring"" task. Consider this shredder unit for home and or office.

  Great shredder - it shreds paper. It'll take a credit card or a couple stuffed envelopes or 8-ish sheets of paper at a time with relative ease.Unfortunately after not quite 2 years of ownership with sporadic use, the Auto feature has broken. Now it will shred things, but it will not shut off automatically. It will keep going and going and going until I manually turn it back to ""off"".  I've checked for stuck paper or blockages, ran it forward/reverse multiple times, to no avail.Note that there are worse things in life. But this was a feature, and it is no longer. Alas I shall continue to shred with  manual operation.

  It's a shredder... it shreds paper. We had a large stack of paper that needed to be shredded and it took us a while to get through it because the machine would get too hot after about 45 minutes of use. We'd let it sit for about 20-30 and then get back at it. We usually aimed for 5 sheets or less. When doing 6 you could tell it was starting to really try to push it all through. The bin fills up quickly, we found that we had to remove the shredder and push the shredded paper down 1-2 times to fill up the can. We have no snags with it, runs as expected and after shredding a roughly 10-12 inch stack of paper within a couple of weeks, the blades are still sharp and the engine is still kicking. Great value for the price you pay.

   I'm writing this review on the same day that I first received this item, but I may forget to review it later so may as well give a first-impressions review, and the first impressions are great! I'm in the process of moving, and I discovered that I had way too many documents in need of secure disposal, and rather than try and deal with the mess of burning them, I turned to this little fellah for my basic shredding needs. The setup was very intuitive. I didn't even need to refer to the manual (as I tend to not do at first lol). All that's needed is to properly place the shredding component atop the waste bin (my bin had a sticker on the correct side showing which edges should match up).While I was able to shred 8 pages on occasion, they were thinner pages of paper, so it's best to keep with the 6-page limit and lower. It's an affordable, BASIC shredder that doesn't require you to remove staples, which I appreciate. Don't expect to shred a lot in a short amount of time: you're better off purchasing a heavy-duty shredder if speed is a concern. However, I didn't mind the half-hour I spent shredding two-bins worth of paper, and since I took little breaks in between verifying the information on certain documents, the overheating light never came on; I imagine that's only after extended, consecutive usage, which again... if you're in that much of a rush, best to buy a heavy-duty shredder.I trust that this will last a good while, especially since I also bought the lubricant sheets that were recommended on this order page. Should anything change, I'll post an update.

  I have needed a new shredder for a while and so I had a decent back-log of papers that needed to be shredded and then I planned to use the shredder for light use.  There is no way I wanted to pay for the size shredder I should have gotten to clear my backlog so I crossed my fingers and got this one.  I used it for 3 days straight.  Yes, it overheats.  Yes, you need to wait 15-30 mins for it to cool down.  Yes, the bin/shredder is kinda small.  No, don't even think of putting more than 6 pages in.  BUT if you are planning for light/moderate use over the longterm, you cannot beat this one for the price.UPDATE:  I've now had this for 3 months and after clearing may backlog I haven't used it.  Pulled it out and it keeps dying.  Can't even shred 5 pages never mind 6.  Every group I put in gets stuck, I have to rip it all out and start over.  At this rate I might as well just shred my papers by hand.  I guess this is priced as a disposable shredder??

  Works just like it should. Granted, I'm not shredding industrial amounts of stuff, just old tax forms, etc., but I shredded two bins of stuff, including some old credit cards, and didn't have a single problem with overheating or anything. Of course, I didn't try to feed it whole stacks of stuff at a time, but this seems to work fine by me. Oh, and look on Amazon Warehouse. I saved $5 on a ""like new"" one and really, it's just fine. If you need to shred a bigger volume, then you might want to spend more, but for general home use and to shred up your daily junk mail, this is a good deal.

  I got item from Amazon Warehouse. When received feeding slot had shredded paper jammed in feeding slot. Took the time to clear it thinking that last person did not know proper operation of shredder. Somehow the shredded paper back into the feeding slot and jams in there. The machine remains operational but is hard to clear the jammed paper in feeding slot making the machine useless until you clear the papers. You can try reversing or turning the machine upside down to clear the paper but that does not work. Also, it struggles with only six pages of paper but is advertised to handle twelve or if you feed an envelope with a folded single piece of paper you can really hear the machine struggle. Maybe I just got a lemon.

  I wouldn’t put more than 6 pages, it really depends on the thickness. But really if you need anything more, you should probs get an industrial shredder. This is a perfect house shredder for junk mail or small office/desk shredder for shredding documents with important info. Had this for a couple of months and works great!It’s a great shredder if you don’t have BAGS and BAGS of stuff to shred and are not wanting to spend a lot on an industrial shredder. As long as you properly proportion the papers you will be golden. :)

  This paper shredder is nice. It has wheels that roll on carpet with ease. Shreds through a stack of paper with no problem. I haven’t had it get jammed up at all. It’s not to loud which I like a lot. I didn’t realize when I purchased it how big it actually was going to be. It’s BIG! The plus to its size is that you won’t have to empty it as often. If size isn’t an issue for you then I would definitely recommend purchasing it.

  I had about 20 years of documents to shred now that we're in the digital age. I ran this thing for a few hours at a time just about every day for 3 weeks to consume it all. In the end, I should have just paid someplace like UPS to dispose of my papers (for about $1/pound), it would have been about the same expense just none of my time :) I did find a few interesting trips down memory lane; amazing how time fly's. I used this machine to chew up a few hundred pounds of paper and dozens of CD's without a hitch never once ran into any issues with jamming or overheating.

  Bought this a couple of weeks ago and so far it has worked very well. Had a bag full of paper that needed shredding and it did take a couple of sessions to get through it and allow for the appropriate cool down time, but it made it through like a champ. Only potential negative feedback, although slight: sometimes the shredding sensor can be tricky to trigger especially if shredding just one page; the flimsiest thing on the shredder is the switch which feels like it might come off/ apart very easily (but hasn't); it would be great if the bin had some type of handle or handholds to help carry it when dumping it out.

  Okay, first things first, this is one heavy duty piece of equipment.  I've been using it for a couple of months now and still impresses me every time I use it.  I was a bit shocked at the weight when I took it out of the box.  It clearly has a large motor and weighs at least double what the cheap discount store shredders weigh.  I also sprang for the few extra bucks to get the 8 sheet version thinking that it might actually last a little longer than my previous Walmart shredders.So, I plugged it in and tested it with a large ""pre-approved"" credit card envelope.  This thing pulled that envelope through there like it was nothing.  The motor didn't even hint at straining.  And the output is nothing more than confetti.  There is absolutely no way anyone is going to piece those documents back together.Tired of playing tug of war with your cheap shredder and trying to pick the crumpled pieces out so you can feed the next document through?  This is your solution.  Nice work Amazon, you picked a serious winner to put your brand name on.

  We ordered this for my mom in April but she just now opened up the box. (It’s now June and can’t return item)  Worked great for about 5 min.  Then it jammed even though I only Put in 5 sheets...suppose to be able to take up to 12.  Took me about 20 min of clearing the jam.  Started shredding again.  Now it won’t start up.  It’s not overheated, can hear noise but can’t put in paper.  I really Liked the cross cut feature but I wouldn’t spend the money on this.  Worked for maybe. Total hour.

  This shredder didn't last long. After only a few months it got a paper jam during routine use. I didn't put more in there than your are supposed to. The motor stops when this happens and the only option is to run it in reverse. When I did, the paper bunched up in the shedding mechanism and the motor seized up. My husband took it apart to clear out the paper but it's not really designed to be repaired and didn't work well after that. It finally died completely a year later. I'm looking for a new shredder and will not be replacing it with the same one.

  AmazonBasics 6-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper & CC ShredderWhen I first got it I had to catch up on about 4-5 minutes of chopping up papers. It worked fine. From that point on I just put the bills into it and it does great. I keep reading about it getting overheated and having to pause shredding. I haven't gotten there yet. For my usage, I never will so I don't care about those reviews.I took off a star because, like many others have written, the item has some tiny pieces of paper in it and some scratches in the can (not on the motorized unit). It is very clean so I don't think it is a used item. There weren't many scraps at all which wouldn't be the case if truly used. Maybe it was tested. Maybe it was packaging as some parts came from another manufacturer to where it is assembled. If Amazon wrote in the description about why this happens then I would be okay with it as I could make an informed decision before I buy. But I remove a star for not setting expectations correctly so now I/we have to guess if we are getting a used product. I don't like to buy something and have doubts.Otherwise, like I said, this thing functions perfectly for my chopping up bills every month. I would recommend it for at least the same use.

  I’m finally important enough to have documents to shred!What this little—and it is little—shredder lacks in size makes up for in vicious shredding abilities. If you have the occasional document, spam mail or credit card that needs to be disposed of security, this little guy is the one for you. I would not recommend it for an office. If you have piles of paperwork to shreds you might have to empty the bin multiple times.Like I said, it’ll dispose of sensitive spam mail on a daily basis. The actual teeth are more than durable and the unit has an almost overpowered sound to it.Looking for a household shredder? You just found it.

  I am a mechanical engineer and I purchased this item in 2016. Being paperless, very little has gone through this machine, in fact, less than one container as it has never been dumped. The product failed in early 2019, less than 3 years old. This thing is a piece of junk and as Amazon will not stand behind their labeled product line. I will be purchasing a new paper shredder from Costco, who has an excellent program of treating their customer's well when products fail well before the end of their service life.I will not purchase another amazon basics product until they stand behind their products.

  After 34 years at work, I had six filing cabinets of accumulated paper — and ya know, some of it contained sensitive information that I was not comfortable trusting to other eyes to shred.  After reading hours of reviews, I settled on this model.  Out of the box, it’s worked well.  Because I’m composting my shredding — and the composer fills — I’m not shredding a lot at once so I’m not testing the limits of the motor.  But for what I ask of it, it’s competently delivered.

  This shredder works great, until it gets jammed. It's actually not that difficult to open it up, unjam it, and close it back up. The problem is that some of the internal parts are total crap and snap off. I'm talking about the photosensitive led's (at least that's what they appear to be), which are attached to the top half, just literally snapped off.Lesson learned, but just spend a little more and hopefully get something much better.

  My old shredder finally crapped out on me and I bought this one last year. It's been great - it shreds all types of things with ease! Old credit cards, thicker papers still enclosed inside the envelope, decent number of pages at a time without getting stuck.It does have its limits so I would use common sense. If you're not sure if the shredder can handle it, first try shredding fewer pages and listen to how the grinding mechanism sounds. If it's trying pretty hard and moving slowly, you know you're pushing it. Again, just common sense. I don't even take staples out and it still shreds like a charm. I highly recommend - it's a great value!

  Not the greatest cross cut shredder, but you get what you pay for.  I find that I feed it only a single page at a time for the best results.  If I feed more than that it really sounds as if it is struggling.  I initially purchased this shredder as I had a large box of personal documents that I wanted to shred before putting out in the recycling.  It was a slow process, but over several weeks and many short sessions, the task was accomplished.  Now, I only need to use it on a limited basis, so its lack of power is not an issue.  If you only have minor jobs, this shredder will be just fine.**Update** After a year of minimal usage, I could no longer leave the shredder in the Auto mode as it would cycle continuously if the switch was left in this position.  There did not appear to be any paper stuck in the shredding gears or other blockage that would cause this to occur. In early June, 20 months after purchase, the shredder ceased functioning all together.  For a shredder that was used to shred less than a dozen pages, once a week, I am very disappointed in its longevity.  I realize it was a $30 shredder, but even in our disposable society I expected to get a few more years out of the machine.

  The product looks nice, easily wheels around, and arrived timely. I read previous reviews that said it was a work horse and was working great for numerous users so I ordered it.  It came in a large box but was not really secured down with packing.  We opened it up and used it right away and it worked.  Unfortunately we tried to use it this morning and it doesnt work.  Tried all the trouble shooting techniques so I checked online and it had an option to be called.  I chose that vs email and was called right away!  The amazon staff was super friendly and issued a refund right away and for UPS to pick it up at the store for a return.  Great service from Amazon but poor product durability.

  This is a great deal for a home office shredder.  It works as intended and does not make a mess when shredding paper.  Have only had it for a couple of weeks, but am pleased with the quality thus far for the money.  I would recommend this product.  However, keep in mind this is a cross-cut shredder and not a micro-cut - thus, if you need a machine that will really shred your documents so they're entirely unrecognizable and near impossible to piece back together, then this is not the machine for you.  Cross cut shredders are mildly secure and good for most professions/documents where the information handled is mildly sensitive.

It works really, really well!  I am pleasantly surprised!  Know that the shredder head is specifically designed for the container it sits upon, and so it's not one of those that will function on top of any container.  I unload the shredded paper from the container once weekly.  I do recommend this product!  Thanks, Amazon!

  Years ago there was an incident with our old auto-start shredder and my cat who thought it was a great place to lay because it was warm (after a visit to the vet, some pain medication and time - the fur grew back but we just threw the shredder away because that was just too unpleasant a memory).  So then for years we just threw all the junk mail and bills and anything else with personally identifiable information on it in a plastic bin and every so often tossed it in the fireplace with a match.  But eventually we got tired of the mess and decided to get a new shredder. It's definitely smaller.  It's difficult to see in a photo that just shows the shredder.  We don't keep it plugged in.  It cuts things to a nice small size.  We put a plastic bag in the bin to make clean-up easier.  I toss the shreddable stuff behind the shredder and then once a week plug it in and take care of everything all at once.  I haven't used it enough to have any problems with anything getting stuck or needing to clean it, but I remember that from past ones, occasionally needing to clean it.  It does slow a little bit with more pages as others have commented, but it still sounds robust and up to the job.

  This is a delicate and temperamental little thing! It says it takes up to 8 sheets but it jams when I shred an empty envelope. Paper that does not cycle through properly will build up under the safety lip on the opening where you put the paper, and there is NO way to remove it and clear the debris. I feel like Macgyver, trying to find all the ways to find something thin and safe enough to stick in there, and clear. (Something it specifically says you should NOT do! But The design flaw left me no choice, if I still want to use it.)Overall if they redesign so you can open and clear the blades, is pretty handy! If not, it’s an exhausting and time-consuming process.

  I wanted to shred cardboard boxes to use as mulch in my garden and to use as bedding for my worms. I also wanted to find a way to use up all of these Amazon boxes! So I went with the cheapest one I could find and this does a great job with the cardboard. I usually have to cut the cardboard down to size but that's no problem. One thing I didn't expect is that I can use a grocery plastic bag to line the bucket. It fits perfectly. I just shred the cardboard then pull out the bag and tie the handles. It's a great use for the bags.

  This workhorse does a great job!  And when it stops it's because it's getting hot and needs to cool down - but that took quite awhile - probably a good 10 minutes of SOLID shredding.  Also, when you empty, be sure to put the top back on in the same direction (even tho it fits both ways) otherwise it won't work!  Thought when I did that at first, it needed a longer time to cool off - but it's a safety feature that the top must go on the right way.  Great product, reasonable price!

  This is a very good shredder for the price. I've had it for some time now and it's not failed me. It's shredded different thicknesses of paper with no issues. It shreds credit cards with ease. It's probably not fair to really rate the noise level. What shredder (in my opinion) is ever quiet enough! And for the price you certainly cannot expect a whisper of a shred! As for maneuverability my only complaint is the lid. It's too bad it doesn't snap on. It comes off too easily when moving the shredder from spot to spot. Perhaps if it was designed to snap on and off instead of simply sitting on top of the basin it would be a better deal. Overall though I'd recommend buying this shredder. It will take 8 sheets and shred them with ease. It does as advertised. Great deal!

  It works as stated and keep working so far(over a month).PRO: Very affordable, works as intended. If you only do occasional (up to a few times a day) shredding, this is perfect.CON/TIPS: It may over heat and you have to wait for it to cool down. No, it is not broken, but the over heat shutdown(will not turn on) safety make it look like broken. Just wait and it will work again. I let it sit over night last time it happen (only happen once). If you intended to use it continuously for 2hrs+, this properly will not suit your need.

  I've had this shredder for about 1.5 years. I used it occasionally (about once per month) and shredded the normal junk mail. I made sure to remove anything stick, staples, and all foreign material. It definitely got the job done. Unfortunately it stopped working suddenly while I was shredding a pile of papers. I've checked for jams and tried all the troubleshooting I could. It no longer shreds forward and won't even go into reverse. I suppose it's what I can expect as far as durability for the price. I am disappointed though since it wasn't used often and only for basic shred jobs. May have to reconsider AmazonBasics and spend a few extra bucks to buy things that last.

  Our old shredder came from the dump, where it came from the free box;  who knows how long it had been used.  It gave us 10 years of moderate usage.  When it finally gave up the ghost, we replaced it with this brand new model - that lasted all of 2.5 years.  Our use is not intense, and we were very careful with it.  But now the automatic shutoff is broken; you have to manually switch it on and off.If I were you, I'd buy some other brand than Amazon for this.

  I rarely write reviews, but I will be contacting both amazon and the manufacturer about an issue.I came home 3 weeks ago and noticed an odd smell and weird sound when I walked in the door.  I have a home office for the occasional shredding that I do.  THE SHREDDER HAD TURNED ON ITSELF and was running for an indeterminate amount of time....to the point that it had started to overheat.  Thank goodness it hadn't gotten worse.  I shudder to think if I was on holiday for days - could it have started a fire???I promptly tossed it out and will be complaining to Amazon about it.

  We needed a little shredder to keep up with the volume of mail and documents we receive at home which need to be shredded. After looking at a few items online and at local stores, this Amazon Basics shredder seemed like it would be a good fit for our needs. It has proved to be a good match. Initially I had a good backlog of things to shred, I may have put more than 8 sheets at a time in the machine, and it kept up. The bin fills up quickly, but that it to be expected in such a small compact unit.  The window in the bin is helpful in knowing how full the bin is. The unit has some built in safety features such as automatically turning off when the paper starts to press the top off the bin.

  It came as described. It can really only handle to shred 6 pages at once max. If you have a lot of papers to shred and you want to spend a little more for a 10-sheet Shredder or higher number you may want to spend the extra $$$. It has build in safety features that shuts off automatically if the litter box has become too full or the machine overheats. Saves you a lot of cleaning up if you are busy shredding away. All in all a perfect little machine that serves its purpose.

  It has not jammed on us yet and it has made beautiful confetti out of everything we put through it. We follow the instructions though and haven't tried to put 176 pages through at a time, or a frying pan, or anything crazy. But it definitely does the job for shredding... things. What kind of things? Look, just stuff, okay! You sure ask a lot of questions buddy.

  It works great, and is a good size. We had this model at my work (small business), and I just bought one for my home office. I am mindful of how many sheets I use and how long I run it so I don't overheat it. Sometimes it just stops because it runs out of room. I push the paper down in the bin and it starts right back up. Works with staples and credit cards and creates smaller pieces then a typical shredder (although it's not a microshredder). Recommend it!

  I received this shredder a few weeks ago, and so far I am very pleased with its performance. I had a large backlog of documents that I wanted to shred, and this nimble shedder made quick work of all of it. I started with just a page at a time, but I found that it easily handles stacks of 3-4 pages. It says it will handle up to six at a time, but it seems to slow the gears down a bit, so I tried to stick with just a few.At one point, perhaps because I was a bit overzealous, it did stop shredding. However, upon reading the manual, I saw that it has a safety deature that prevents it from burning up the motor. In the event that the machine gets too hot, it switches itself off for 30 minutes to give the motor a chance to rest. Sure enough, when I came back 30 minutes later, it started right up and worked like a charm.An added bonus is the credit card shredding feature. As it happened, I has two credit cards that had expired that I was going to cut up. I popped them into the shredder, and it cut them down without a problem. There is even a specific slot in the middle of the feeder for credit cards. Great feature!I will say that it is most certainly loud, but then again it is shredding the documents in two directions, so that's to be expected. Overall, it works just as it should. Obviously, this is not a machine for heavy-duty use or for really big jobs. It is meant to be used on occassion, and when used as such, it functions brilliantly.

  This shredder is advertised as shredding credit cards.I ran an amazon prime credit card through it, which is a particularly thick and durable card.  It bent the metal blades on the inside and broke the shredder.  :(ironically I still bought the same shredder a second time to replace the broken one.  But don't use it for credit cards.  Excellent with paper, bad with plastic.  Since advertised as shredding credit cards = 1 star for failing advertised function.

  Returning this product for a refund.  This is the ""best seller"" in this price range on Amazon.  I saw the photo of the item, recognized it for the one we previously had, but thought, well there must have been improvements made, etc., if Amazon is putting their name on it and its the best seller, so I purchased it.  It's not any better, maybe even worse, it is the same shredder we previously had just with an Amazon logo on it.  The old one when the motor got hot would stop working and we'd have to wait for it to cool off to continue.  This one, the second time we used it, and really hadn't shredded that much, did the same thing and even when the motor cooled off, wouldn't work again.  This one is shot on the second use.  This was just everyday junkmail residential shredding, not commercial amounts by any means.  We'll pay the extra and upgrade this time.

  They may be stretching it on the 8 sheet capacity. This unit does not like more than about 5 and even then it grunts and bogs down. I'll just keep spoon-feeding it paper until it fails and will report back with more information.It is loud. Not a big deal, it is a paper shredder.It is heavy. Again, no big deal, I do not take it backpacking with me.It does shred paper.It is priced very well.

  Ordered this because it seemed like a good product for the price, and Amazon Basics has been pretty good to me so far.Unfortunately, this time it didn't work out.The item is very top-heavy for starters. The shredder module is heavy while the bin it attaches to is flimsy and light in comparison. Could use some weight in the bin so that it doesn't tip over so easily. (And no, I did NOT drop the shredder module.)The item would not function when plugged in--it wouldn't even turn on. I tried every outlet in my house.It's possible that only this one was a dud, but I don't want to waste my time re-ordering this model only to get another dud. Returning this and getting a different brand.

  Great, great product. Works fast and well. But I have to say, do not try to shred food items such as lettuce. I learned this little ""factoid"" when I was hankerin' for a delicious Italian-style deli sub, with the cappicola, salami, shredded lettuce and fixin's.  I thought, ""why not?"" and jammed a few leafs of lettuce through the machine's pie hole. It jammed up and I can't get all the lettuce out. It's gross!  I think the manufacturer should place a warning label on the machine, ""Not for Food"". Otherwise a top-notch product. Better than a Tom Cruise movie!

  Got this to shred paper with for use as cat litter, which is a free alternative to clay litter. Just got it today and shredded a phone book, lots of receipts, and some junk mail easily without any problem. Of course I did the phone book a few pages at a time...This machine will pay for itself within a month by not having to buy cat litter. If it breaks down later I will update this then, but do not foresee that happening. It's a good shredder.Meow!

  There have been reports that this shreds only three sheets. If we're talking about 20-bl paper, I can confirm that that's not the case. This shredder can definitely handle 5 or 6 sheets (20-lb paper) at a time. Remember, this is a light-duty shredder, not an industrial shredder! Make sure you don't exceed the 6-sheet capacity.The unit will stop working if it overheats. This occurs if it is run for long periods with very short no breaks between each paper feed and/or if the 6-sheet capacity is exceeded. If it stops working due to overheating, you simply have to let the unit sit for about 15-20 minutes to allow it time to reset, at which time it should start working again.The unit has a switch for auto-detect, off, and reverse positions (used for when the paper is jammed).The shredded pieces are approximately 1-1/2"" by 1/4"" each. That's plenty secure when you're shredding in big batches, which makes reconstituting the documents practically impossible.For a shredder with a higher security, consider the

  This thing is an absolute beast. I don't usually write reviews, but I am so pleased with this product that I just had to. This is way quieter then my much smaller shredder. It ran for well over 30 minutes and I ran out of paper before it overheated. I shredded a box full of papers and it never once over heated. What would have taken me days with my old shredder took about 40 minutes with this one. Every time it stopped I thought that it surely had overheated, but instead the door would be slightly ajar or the bin would be full. The bin fits perfectly in a garbage bag. Very happy with this purchase

  All was good until it just died without a warning. I bought this shredder January 2019. Today 11/2019 I decided to shred a bunch of documents and NOTHING. No motor involvement whatsoever. Just dead. At first I thought maybe the plug fell outta the wall but not the case. Electrical things happen, so I took it to another outlet just to be sure and still NOTHING. I wish I would have spent more money on a name brand shredder. I just threw $36.00 away on this contraption. Spend more money and don’t buy this cheap shredder.

  It's a shame that a product sold and supported by Amazon doesn't last more than a month. The electrical cord is loose and therefore the machine does not work. And now I can't return it because ""the window to return this item is closed"". Who knew that Amazon sold lousy products. I really don't shred that many documents. Use it mainly to shred items of a personal nature, so being a household of 2 people it can't be that much and yet here I am with a broken shredder that I can't return. Guess I'll have to shop elsewhere if this is the customer support you get. At least I can always turn to my CC and get their support.

  This shredder shredded everything I put in it except labels on bubble wrap. I was looking for a basic shredder that could handle credit cards, paper, and a few staples here and there. This shredder fit the bill!I put regular paper, heavy-weight paper, credit cards, stapled documents, newspaper, and mailing labels in the shredder. Everything was shredded great with no clogs in the blades. When I put mailing labels that were on bubble wrap, the shredder got clogged. Because all the other stuff went through fine, the plastic bubble wrap was the problem. I put a bag in the basket so when the basket is full, the shreds are in the bag and ready to go in the recycle bin.It is a good size for a home shredder for use with junk mail, old credit cards, old bills, etc. I like that it is not a huge shredder, so I can store it in a closet without it taking up much room. It has an automatic shut off when the motor gets hot or when the blades are stuck (paper jam or plastic jam in my case). The motor/shredder sits on top of the basket. All I have to do to empty the basket is lift the motor/shredder off the basket and take out the bag.This is the first AmazonBasics product that I have purchased. So far, I am impressed with the quality of a 'basic' product.

  I bought this shredder after over heating and breaking my old one, that was only two years old. This things shreds like a champ, credit cards no problem, papers after papers no over heating and even thick paper with ease. Now I was skeptical at first and not going to lie tried to push it to its breaking point without actually breaking it. Stacks of like 10 papers with a staple! Way to go amazon something that doesn’t break, now I’ve had this for a few months now and it’s still as great as when I first bought it.

  If you're looking for a smaller cross cut shredder, this one is OK. It is working pretty well right now. The price is pretty fair for a smaller shredder. Very compact & could even fit in a drawer. Not real super quiet, but it is quieter than my other shredder. Just make sure you maintain the blades & keep them sharp, & it should last for a long time.

  Overall I’m satisfied but I dispute the description that it can handle 8 sheets at a time unless it’s referring to tissue paper. About 4-5 sheets is about the most it can handle which for me is fine. Also, since I’m catching up on shredding, I’ve discovered that doing about 150 sheets or so it will overheat. The price is good and it’s unreasonable to expect it to be a high volume shredder for the price but point out the limits for others to consider and be aware.

  I don't think this is cross-cut, it makes strips about 3-cm x 3-mm wide, the cross-cut shredder would make diamond cuts.  It arrived after several weeks of delivery during the riots, and appeared used.  There were a few shreds of paper in it, and no manual. (Maybe it was shredded?). As far as mobility goes, the casters are really flimsy, but they can easily be removed, possibly upgraded.  I payed about $3.00 (yes three), and it is doing a decent job so far. It crunches those fake credit-card junk mails without opening, and doesn't seem to struggle.  I haven't tried it with the advertised stack thickness or a CD yet.  I am happy with it so far, for $3.

  My 10-year old shredder finally gave up. I decided to look for a similar shredder. Cross cut is adequate for me. Micro cut seems over kill. Three features I like about this AmazonBasics model. Price is right. It has wheels. Large pull-out bin. I don't know why some are upset at the noise level. You are running a motor shredding paper after all. Let's see if this one will last 10 years.

  Awful. Purchased this in April, it's now June and it's already dead. It has some weird safety piece across the top so you have to place sheets in on an angle, which then causes them to crinkle mid-shred. Once it starts crinkling, it almost always jams. Every,single,time. I got to where I had to shred a single sheet at a time...and it would STILL jam. Absolute garbage. I've never been so frustrated with a shredder in all my life. DO NOT BUY!!

  Having used the shredder quite a bit, I am very happy with it. It has no trouble going through multiple pieces of paper and it fills right up to the top.For most people it is a perfect size for a home office, but for large volumes, you might want something a bit larger. I do like the clear plastic to show me when it gets near the top. I usually then just turn it to OFF and then take the top off and push down the paper. I'm very happy with the price and quality of this purchase.

  But still a very good one for the money. This model is excellent for light duty home use. As soon as I took it out of the box and set it up, I went right to work to shred up mounds of papers and magazines and what not. And after only a few minutes of use it jammed up big time! And I was like... WTF?! But the instructions were clear on what to do, I did it, and was shredding again in about 20 minutes. If you've been running it for awhile it'll overheat and stop working to cool off. And you have to keep it oiled. Any kind of cooking oil will do. Just put some in an applicator bottle and squeeze some along the shredding line. And certain things won't shred. Like cardboard and plastic sheets. If you get an envelope in the mail packed with stuff, hard stuff you can feel inside, don't run it through shredder because it'll get jammed. Open the letter and shred the contents seperately. It's running like a kitten now with no problems at all. So glad I got it and without breaking the bank. This keeps my house clutter free of papers. Anything I don't need to save goes straight to file 13.

  Had to return as we have only used it for less than 48 hours and it has been clogged several times, sometimes we even had to use the pliers to pull out the paper or credit card pieces.  It only works on average for about 7 minutes at a time, one time we got 11 minutes out of it before the red button came on.  We never put more than 6 regular pieces of paper in it and only put one paper in if it was thicker.  If it wouldn't stop working it would be great but it just doesn't do what it is supposed to do.  We need it to work, hope we can find another one that will do the job.

  It served its purpose well. Was able to shred extra papers in my filing cabinet and sell cabinet. No jams so far. The opening is acceptable though narrow. I made sure not to open or close bin door too rough so the little tab would not snap off. Also I shuffled unit around after shredding a lot so bin did not fill up in a narrow pile as opposed to filling the bucket. Shred up to the 15 sheets no problem.

  This is the worst thing I ever purchased from AMAZON.  I kept the number of sheets down to 4 for the first use.  It didn't last even 30 minuets.  Jam happened.

Not too large, not too small for the job, does a good job of shredding paper and plastic cards, and was a good price.  (HINT:  With ANY shredder--do not try to shred the plastic bag that mail-order medications come in.  It takes about a hour to unplug the shredder, pick out all the plastic shreds that have wrapped themselves around the teeth, plug it back in, and repeat the process--over and over and ........

  It will beat the price of any other shredder in its class. NO! This isn't the shredder you can use when the FBI is knocking and you are looking to destroy documents fast as possible.

  This shredder is terrible.  The size is just barely wide enough for a sheet of paper and if you don't get it straight it will jam up.

  My old unit would not always shed the strips properly, so it would have been possible for someone to glean information off of the left over paper. THIS shredder chews up the documents into TINY little bits that make it impossible to steal info! The low cost of this unit, and its ability to completely destroy documents are two fabulous attributes. I would recommend this for personal use, or home office use. I do not believe this unit would properly service a professional office/business, as it will begin to overheat after 20  sheets of shredding.

  This is the best cross shredder that I have used in a while! It doesn't jam, shreds credit cards, DVDs, and even thin cardboard. I feel safe using this to shred important documents. It is compact so it fits anywhere, even in a small office. It can handle even the largest of jobs. You have to make sure that you only put in one or two pieces of paper at a time. I like the fact that it has a finger guard so that you cannot get your finger stuck in the shredder. Older models that I have used in the past do not have the finger guard, so I have caught the tips of my fingers in there several times. If the machine have a jam, all you have to do is put it in reverse and pull out the jam. There is no need to turn it over and try to clear the jam out yourself. This is one of the best crosscut shredder's that I have used in a while. It is great for small businesses, students, or individuals that want to shred important documents but do not have the time or money for a shredding company. The lid comes off easily sold that the paper can be disposed of quickly. It snaps back together so that you can get to shredding more documents and credit cards. The only problem that I have had, and I have had this problem in the past, is that when the shredder gets hot, it will immediately shut down. At the bottom, you can see a picture of how the shredding looks after it is done. You can't get any better shred that this!

  I’m using it to shred personal financial and confidential information and documents.  It works by completely destroying the paper, but it’s quite slow.  Have not tried to shred more than 4 or 5 pages at a time, so cannot speak to its reported ability to do 15 sheets at once.  It has not overheated or stopped operating, even after running for over 10 minutes.  For a paper shredder it appears relatively expensive, but that depends on how long a life it will eventually experience.

  I am shredding about thirty years worth of receipts and statements.  This shredder is far better than any I have used in the past, including some that cost four times as much.  It has all of the necessary safety features and is super-simple to operate.  The feeder is perfect, the bin is ample, and the noise level is tolerable.  In order to test the unit, I managed a paper jam, reversed the feed and it cleared immediately.  I ran it until the temperature cutout activated.  I let it sit for about twenty minutes and it was ready to go again.  I would advise anyone with the need for a consumer level shredder to give this one a try.

  Review written on 11/13/19.... Purchased this product 11/2018.  From time to time it would make a clicking noise when shredding paper. Today it just kept running and had to be switched to the stop position to stop. Followed the Troubleshooting Guide in trying to remendy the problem to no avail. Called Customer Service and Rep. after answering several questions about what was being shredded she basically told me that their warranty would not apply because I shredded items on their ""Never Shred List""  Have had other brand shredders and never had an issue similar to this and was able to shred almost anything. Lesson learned ""never buy a product that sells cheaper then most, you get what you pay for.""

  I like the easiness of use and the small frame.  It works perfectly for shredding credit cards and papers when you don't have much to shred on a weekly basis to keep your files down to a minimum.  The only issue I have is transportability; if only there were easy side handles to carry this unit from one place to another without it being so top heavy, and if only there was a latch that could safely secure the top shredder piece to the trash unit it sits on, then I'd rate it 5 stars.  For the price, however, it works well.  I try to give the motor a rest for about 60 minutes between 6 shredding items, and I will follow the instructions on when to use the lubricant sheets, so as to not burn out the motor.

  I've given up on owning a shredder for more than a year.  Unless you spend huge $$ they'll all wear themselves out, understandable given the nature of what they're doing.  That being said this is a great shredder, a little loud but very small and does the job well.  (rate maneuverability??  really?  it's a shredder!).  Time will tell for longevity but at ~30$ I can buy ten of these for what I paid for my last shredder (which only lasted just past 1 year).

  This unit replaced a different make/model that finally stopped working.

  I've never been disappointed by AmazonBasic products, and this shredder is no different. I was very pleased with how it feels. Many ""store brand"" items often feel cheap but this felt like a product of much higher quality than you would expect for the price. Plugged it in right from the box and tried it out and it did it's job. Started off with just a couple sheets of paper and worked my way through some card stock, magazine pages. It says it can handle 8 pages and I put that to the test and fed it at an angle. Despite crumpling into the feed slot creating a bulkier thicker paper, it fed right through with no issues.

  Pretty dope, but for the cost, I'd hope so. Chugged a little for me on 5 sheets, and actually locked up on me at 7. I'd give this 4 stars but people only read 5 and 1. I'm still comfortable with 5 though. The lock-up wasn't also a jam; I was able to pull the paper out and start again. Runs great for the most part. If you want something that works 24/7 under all conditions, you can buy one double the price. I strongly feel this was worth what I paid, slight drawbacks considered. It'll absolutely get the job done.

  I love amazon, and I usually can order from amazon basics and have complete trust in the product, however this one has slightly tarnished their otherwise sparkling reputation with me.The holding box for this shredder is just barely as tall as a piece of paper, so that fact alone has reduced it to being used solely for important documents in our office, since we don't want to go through the hassle and mess of constantly having to dump it out. The thing I found really disappointing about this though, is that although it says it can shred 6 pieces of paper at once, it has trouble with 3 and often jams on 4, and this shredder is a monster to try to unjam.for a small office like mine, it isn't to big of a problem, but if you have a business that shreds a lot, you will not like this shredder at all.

  On a daily basis, when I shred only one or two sheets, this shredder works fine. And it does credit cards OK, too. However, I have been doing a yearly clean-up and am finding the 8-sheets-at-a-time claim is pure myth. Even at 4-sheets-at-a-time, the machine clogs before it ever overheats. I could deal with overheating -- find something else to do while it cools down. But this clogging means I am spending more time picking shredded paper out of the teeth with a pair of pliers than I am spending shredding. And yes, I am being careful to align the paper to go in straight.  Frustrating!

  I purchased this shredder last August 2017 and about a month ago it simply stopped working. Nothing seems to be jammed. I've tried everything I know and simply does nothing - not even a buzz when turned on and now hesitant about Amazon products overall.I was so pleased when received this as it appeared to be high quality and love the extra perk of the window to view when full. Quite disappointed!!!!

  Ok it's a paper shredder. Yes it shreds and it does a really good job. It's heavy and feels durable enough to last a few years of paper shredding parties. Also has the handy dandy credit card shred slot when it's time to retire your visa card. Will it jamb? Darn Skippy it will. But in it's defense I have a guilty pleasure, when receiving a new paper shredder, of finding out just how tough did they think this thing is??? 15 sheets and this sucker is going down.. (no i didn't try 14, I go straight for the kill)...well in their defense it does state its 6 sheets max. Will it reverse 15 sheets of paper you ask? Err.....no. Start digging paper out homer.

  Nicely sized and easy to store. Worked fine for light home use (1-3 bins per month, shredding junk mail and personal info) but after a year and a half something has failed and its stuck on. Still works, but you have to unplug it to stop it from constantly trying to shred. Nothing is jammed in the blades or otherwise visible, so my only option is to replace or take it completely apart by myself. Should not have failed under such light use.

  I bought this shredder because it supposed to have an auto mode where it only turned on when you put something in the shredder, but now it just runs all the time and never shuts off. I came home from work the other day to find the shredder running all by itself! I didn't use it that morning and it definitely wasn't running when I left for work. Who knows how long it was running for, but it was hot and smelled like it was burning up. Waste of money! Could have purchased a cheaper one with a manual on-off switch.

  We got a lot of letters/papers that have our private info and we have been keeping them in a pile, and at one point we were just tired with those papers, just really needed a paper shredder so we could throw the unused important letters/papers away.This paper shredder is amazing! We do prefer the cross-cut paper shredder to the strip-cut one. We've been using this for over two weeks, and so far so good. It came well-packaged, it’s very easy to use, it has a clear plastic window for you to see if the basket is almost full, it has a decent size to collect a lot of cut-papers, and it cut expired credit card well, it’s very safe and comfy to use, also easy to clean. It’s such a life saver, and for the price, it’s a great deal! Will recommend!

  Worked great in the beginning and here we are 5 months later and the paper shredder is dead.  No over heat light or anything, it just won't work.  Of course I didn't get the protection plan so I am out the cost of the shredder and have to and find a different brand to replace this one.

  I had done a lot of reading over the shedders on Amazon, and especially about the Amazonbasics ones. I decided to purchase one after I realized how much stuff I material I wasn't handling as properly as I should be. I've had this since late December or early January. This thing is a champ. Credit cards aren't an issue, and the only time I've seen it slow down is when I put those pesky credit card spam letters straight in without opening it up. (They usually come with the fake paper credit card in them). When I thought it was going to get stuck it just kept trucking. I even spent about a half an hour shredding old check books. It started to smell a little different and I let it cool down for a few minutes before finishing up. It was no issue. It has handled everything I've thrown at it and the bin holds a surprising amount of shredding. I love the added security of the cross cut shredding too. This is now a permanent staple in my office, and was a great buy.

  I used this 20 times at most. After shredding 1 credit card it stopped working and emitted a strong electric odor. When I shook it, I heard what I thought might have been a loose screw. With nothing to lose I opened it and discovered the plastic guide bar inside was broken in half! I did NOT abuse this shredder, and when it did work it crosscut my papers superbly. I only wish it lasted longer. I will now purchase a brand name here on in.

  works perfectly for my small office needs. my last shredder died, so i bought this one. i appreciate the much larger basket underneath (as opposed to my old shredder).this one also shreds credit cards and stuff, apparently, but i haven't yet given that a try. i mostly use it to keep my office paper ""trash"" down, since we don't have paper recycling in my town that is convenient. when my basket gets full i take it home and put it in my compost tumbler, which helps keep the balance going in there. it may not be the most ""organic"" paper in the world with printer inks and such, but i'm comfortable with it, and the shredder is fast.

  I use this a few times a month. Maybe 10-20 sheets of paper per month. This shredder works really well for me. I've had it for 4 years and I haven't noticed any major issues. The biggest issue is that it's noisy, but I can live with 30 seconds of noise per month.

  Bought this in May 2018, and I finally killed it on a heavy shredding day in August 2020. The best feature is the overheat light, since it’ll stop you short if you try to push it. (At least it doesn’t just catch on fire, right?)While it was alive, it did a solid job, and I probably just pushed it a little to hard. I would say 8 sheets is generous for this guy... anything less than 4 sheets seemed to go over easy, but more than that, and the shredder really protested. I’ll probably repurchase, but unhappily, because nothing should only last 2 years.

  I did not like the fact that the top portion (shredder) was too heavy to remove each time to clear out basket of shredded material.

  This shredder works great!  I set it to power on, it sleeps until I feed it!  I don't test it's ability to do more than 3-4 pages at a time and remove all staples just as a precaution and I've never had it jam or block.  I don't use it to shred credit cards because I'd rather just cut those up with scissors and protect this shredder, why risk it?  Ok, yeah, it's pretty noisy, but it's a shredder, and I don't think I've ever seen one that doesn't make noise!  I've had it for about 2 months, and the bin is just about full and it's still running fine!

  I loved this shredder at first but then it suddenly quit working... nothing.  dead.  Obviously, I'm disappointed that the shredder only lasted for 6 months and now I have to buy another one.  I don't shred a lot and never more than 6-8 pages at a time, and only paper, so I don't know why it gave out on me so quickly.  I'm still hoping I can return it.  We'll see how good their customer service really is!********7/27 Update: I contacted Amazon about my shredder, which was well out of the return period, and they just shipped me a brand new shredder, 1-day delivery.  I hope this shredder lasts longer than the first.  I would give the shredder 1 star, and their customer service 5 stars, hence the average 3 star rating.  Thank you Amazon for making things right by me!

  This shredder is a beast! We had a trash bag full of stuff to shred. I figured it would take a couple of days to do since it only runs for so long, but boy was I wrong. I got through the entire bag in one setting. The shredder never jammed, even after putting in more than 15 sheets, and it never overheated. It's a lot quieter than the 6 paper one we had that broke. This shredder was well worth the money and I'm glad we bought it. The only thing, which still isn't an issue, is that it will show the bin is full, but all you have to do is open the door and move the shredded paper around and you will be able to shred a lot more without emptying the bin out. It rolls smoothly and the bin goes in and out very easy.

  I purchased this to shred normal paper that required shredding and cardboard for composting. This thing is a beast. It is heavy but has very nice casters that roll like a dream on a solid surface. The first thing I shredded was the double walled heavy duty box that it came in and it did not overheat or get jammed one time. I have since shredded well over a dozen boxes and it has not given me a single problem. I would highly recommend this paper shredded because it works like a champ.

  You have to use the supplied can, there is an interlok switch ( good thing too). It strains on 6 sheets and credit cards, but my old shredder gave up. Next time I gotta spend over $100 to get an industrial shredder. Does the job however, but I don't want anything with my address on it in my trash, so it gets used quite a bit.After just a few moanths it's slowing down and I recognize that as pending motor failureto make it last, shred no more then two sheet and no credit cards

  This is flimsky plastic construction. The first order cracked in the packing crate, and the second order has a shredder bin that is very thin plastic, and troublesome to get in and out of the shredder for emptying. The 'tracks' for the bin to come in and out are not very substantial.I'm using it, as the motor is still working ok, but the 12 page amazon shredder I had before (and died in about a year) was a much better made product.

  So far so good.  It works like a dream, and the price is great.  I take my serious shredding to a local shredding facility, but there are some items with personal information here and there that I just want to put in the shredding machine.  Mine finally broke after many many years of use, and I was looking for sale at Costco, Office Depot, etc.  Then searched on Amazon, and saw this one with high reviews and the price was better than any ones I saw from Costco and Office Depot.I was cleaning old files, and shredded a bunch of old checks, bank statements, and tax returns.  It was all done in a jiffy!  Worth every cent!

  used for less than twenty minutes, never more than 4-5 sheets at a time. Motor overheated and shredder teeth jammed up and shredder shut off. Won't reset, even after picking remaining paper out of shredder teeth. This was a gift, so it didn't get used right after purchase. The time delay caused the return window to expire, so we're stuck with a non-working device and no possibility of a refund. DO NOT ORDER THIS POS!

  My husband and I ordered this shredded after our old mini shredded died a painful death. I was apprehensive with respect to whether it would work as well as I wanted, but after living with a shredder that, near the end of its life could only handle one sheet at a time, and that required narrower than 8 inches of paper, so every page had to be torn in half before it was fed, I was SO frustrated. Shredding shouldn't take up so much time!Well, now it doesn't. I'm in LOVE with my new shredder. My husband and I acted like children when it arrived, taking turns feeding stuff in and being amazed by it. The receptacle seems like it never fills up. You can shred for ages without emptying it. And it accepts so many pages at one time, and you can feed a full sheet in without having to rip it first. Finally, my shredding time is reduced to mere moments. YAY!

  We had 7 large boxes that contained 20 years worth of receipts, tax forms and medical records, many listed our social security numbers.  I followed the recommendation of only running the shredder for 2 minutes at a time, then allowing for a 30 minute cool down.  I set up the shredded in a spare bedroom and ran the shredder for 2 minutes at my convenience. It took over 3 weeks using this method. All the paper was shredded, put in paper grocery bags, the bags were then stapled shut and placed in our recycling bins.  I examined  a sampling of the shredded papers ad could not identify any of the printed information, including our social security numbers.  Well worth the price.

  I like the price and the ease with which it gobbles up my paper and cuts them into little rectangles. I recommend this for price vs performance. If you want something which might be easier to use, get one with a removable container. They cost a lot more. You have to lift off the top of this shredder to empty the shredded paper container. A small thing that is not a problem for me. It is not very noisy.

  I used this shredder about twice a month and would put about 15 sheets of paper through it (3 sheets per run about 5 times). I was shredding about a week ago, 2 pieces of paper, and it just quit.  Nothing heavy, no plastic credit cards, just paper.  I couldn't get it to go forward or backwards.  It shows a green ready light but won't take any more paper.  I've cleaned it, cleaned the rollers (I even bought the oiled sheets to run through so it's been taken care of) but it just quit.The old saying goes, you get what your pay for.

  This is the third AmazonBasics item I have bought recently and again it looks like a great buy. I had to return a different shredder because it overheated quickly, something this one didn’t do at all. It’s also relatively quiet. The basket size is sufficient for a home use shredder. The unit is very heavy and the shredding elements are open on the bottom, so careful handling is definitely paramount. I absolutely recommend this shredder.

  I ordered this to help organize.  I always end up with a stack of mail to go through by the end of the week (and I'm signed up for paperless everything-I-can!).  This affordable shredder is placed under my entryway console and it keeps me super organized as mail can be sorted right away (shred, keep or recycle) in just one spot.  It gets used about every day and has handled anything thrown at it.  I'm not sure if you're suppose to but I don't even take mail out of the envelope (as long as it isn't too thick).  I love the convenience this slim shredder provides and highly recommend for home use.

  I have had this less than one week, and I used it according to directions.  The unit had jamming problems, which I successfully corrected until this last jam.  There seems to be no reason why the unit jammed this last time.  I used the ""reverse"" button, as required, and horrendous grinding noises result along with visible and audible evidence that something is being thrown against the inside top of the unit.  I actually backed away and placed a deflector over the entry point in case debris was flung out.  I have previously had shredders at my home and at my office and have never had problems like I've had with this shredder.

Also, keep in mind that we use it for home use only. Shredding bills, statements, etc. I've used it almost daily for about a week.1. It's relatively quiet.2. It can easily handle 5+ sheets at a time. Like any shredder, just take your time and don't overload it.3. It's not as big as I thought it would be, but that's not a bad thing. It's low profile, which is fine by me.My assessment is that it's an amazing value at $35.

  I considered this shredder to be one of the best purchases I ever made. I get so many junk mail that contain my personal info and I got tired of hand-tearing those boogers.This shredder gives me a piece of mind knowing that none of my personal info will get compromised. The shredder works really well. It shreds papers to small pieces, like really really small. The unit is a little loud but what do you expect from a shredder? It's not too loud to the point where it's unbearable but it's not the quietest, either (it's called scissors, I think)I've tried shredding 4-5 pieces of paper at a time and it does its job no problem. Oh, and it shreds my unused credit cards effortlessly also. If you get a lot of junk mail or just a lot of mail that contains your personal info, I highly recommend getting a shredder. If you're getting a shredder, this one is the one I'd highly recommend.

  Seems to work fine, but my previous shredder took much wider paper so I find this disappointing.  My other shredder began shredding immediately, but this one hesitates a  few seconds before starting to shred.  Not sure why.

  I purchased this shredder based on three factors- 1) price, 2) size, and 3) ease of use, for my home office. This shredder works as expected- very well. Understanding that it is not an industrial shredder, you must keep the paper thickness in mind. In my experience (I tested this), after 20 minutes of continuous shredding, the machine does need a cooling break (acceptable!) I placed a small garbage bag inside the containment basket. when it is full, I simply lift out the unit and tie up the bag. Limited clean up is the result.I am happy with my purchase, and do recommend this littler unit for personal and small business use.

  Was very disappointed with this shredder. I thought the 6 page would be enough, but realistically it is a 3 page shredder. If I were to put 4 pages, it goes very slowly. It got stuck twice already and I have only used it twice. It is extremely difficult to clear out the jam. You can access the bottom, but not from the top (which is where the paper jams). I was so hopeful seeing the other great reviews. My return window is still available. Thinking of trying out the one for 8 sheets instead.

  I needed a shredder to shred mostly junk mail. Didn't want some huge rolling shredder taking up room, his one is the size of a small trash can, its perfect to keep near the door and out of the way.

  I have needed something to shred all our junk mail without having to open everything to keep from overloading or jamming the shredder. This one has proven efficient. I learned my lesson on not putting addresses from bubble wrap packages through it but I was able to get it out with strategic maneuvering with the help of tweezers without burning out the motor. I like that Amazon tests the product before shipping. It’s sturdy, heavy duty (lid is heavy and solid) and does a great job!

  I shredded a shopping bag full of documents with this product. I didn't need to remove staples. I think inserting 8 pages at a time would be a bit too much, but it had no problem with 4-5 pages at a time. I haven't tried credit cards yet.With a bagful of documents to shred, I soon realized the basket fills up pretty quick (say after 30-40 pages?)  Because I was oblivious to it at first, I once or twice clogged it so bad, I needed to spend a long time unclogging it with a tweezer and a metal dental pick. Once I learned to pay attention to the basket capacity, I only had to dump it before it filled up. Overall, I am reasonably satisfied with the product.

  Been shredding old tax returns for about a half hour. Couple sheets at a time. Emptied the bin and now it won't shred. Waiting for the half hour cool time to see what happens.Edit: Once it cools off you're good to go. This thing cranks along as long as you don't put too much paper in at one time. I generally use it a handful of times a day but this week I started shredding 10 years of business records. Takes time doing a handful of sheets at a time, that's for sure. Emptying the bin over and over makes a mess. Lots of sweeping and vacuuming. But if you don't abuse it, it runs very well.Nov 2018: The shredder (my third one since Feb 2018!) has stopped working.

  This paper shredder is great for personal use, either at home or in the office.  The shredding mechanism works well and the bin is large enough to hold hundreds of shredded documents before reaching its capacity.  I have owned one of these shredders for nearly a year, and I have not experienced any problems with it.The shredding mechanism is powerful enough to handle multiple documents at once without stalling.  It can also handle credit cards.  This shredder is capable of cross-shredding multiple documents at once.  The mechanism cross-shreds to ensure that the end result is more secure.  Because it is cross-cut, it would be nearly impossible for someone to re-assemble the paper and steal information.  This shredder ensures that there will be a certain level of security and permanency to each shred.This shredder can get about as loud as an average vacuum cleaner.  If you use this while you are talking on the phone, it may make it difficult to hear the person on the other end.  It will also interrupt a television show and possibly a conversation.  However, the loudness should only last 2 or 3 seconds, as the sound is only present while something is actually being shred.I would say that I use this shredder a bit more than the ""average person.""  I use it in my home, which is not an office or other professional setting.  However, I do have important documents that need to be shred, but I also use this for paper and printouts that I do not need anymore, as it makes recycling a bit easier for me.  In the months that I have had this and used it in this capacity, I have had a good experience with it.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who needs a reliable cross-cut paper shredder.

  I have had other shredders that failed to shred the number of sheets that the manufacturer said it would. This is rated at 12 and actually shreds 12 with little fuss. The unit is fairly quiet, sheets feed in easily and removing and replacing the top is easy. The shredded paper receptacle is a bit thin walled but it is not under a lot of stress, so am hoping that it is sturdy enough to last till the shred blades die. All in all, after using for a few months, I am happy with the unit.

  This does not work well at all.  It kept sticking with just 2 pages although it states you can do 8 pages at a time.  When you have to empty it, all the papers sticks to the cover and falls out.  I bought it as a gift so it was not opened until 6 weeks later.  I can't even get a full refund for it although it's less than 2 months old and was only used for about an hour or less.  The rep said there was an error in the description for the amount of pages it can handle.  Imagine it can't handle 2 pages at a time.  Buyer beware!

  I expected a lot more from this shredder, other products from Amazon basics have always been good quality. This one falls short!  If you’re just looking for a basic shredder without the capability of shredding credit cards, this would probably be fine. It claims to shred credit cards, but it doesn’t. We tried several and it just makes cuts halfway through and you’re still left with an intact card.  Also it claims to be able to do six pages at once but I have found that it can’t really handle anything more than four.  If I’m just treading 2 to 3 pages at a time, it does fine.

  Full disclosure: I haven’t shredded my mail for months since my last shredder broke. So I knew that me trying to shred the last year of my life was a terrible idea on this 6-sheet paper shredder.Pros: it works pretty good, it’s a good deal, and seems pretty sturdy. This machine is great for everyday document shredding.Cons: the angle of feeding the paper is driving me nuts! You can’t feed it directly from above, you have to angle it slightly and for how short it is, it’s not a good angle for my back. And because of that weird angle I’m terrible at putting the paper in straight, so sometimes the paper bunches up and jams the machine.  It does overheat and stop itself when you’re shredding a ton (which is my fault for not keeping up with getting rid of documents).If you’re a procrastinator and have tons of paper to shred like I do, this is probably not the shredder for you. But if you shred occasionally and don’t have piles, this is an excellent buy for the price.

  As the saying goes.. you get what you pay for... There is no way this can shred 6 pages. On one page it works, two pages it slows down a bit, three pages it is a struggle, four pages... look at photo.  This thing is bound up and would not move.  I had to remove it, rewind it, then get a set of pliers to pull the paper wound around the drum/cutter.  I tried it twice with the same results.  Two pages for me from now on.  If you have a business and need to shred a lot... pass on this.  This is good for an occasional shredding of home paperwork and bills.

  For the price, I guess it’s ok.  Some days it’s frustrating to use.The safety button on the machine, which is supposed to depress when placed on the bucket, doesn’t always press in.  Which prevents the shredder from working.I need to take a piece of cardboard and put it where the button is to get it to work while on the bucket.PITA work around.When it works, it’s great.  When it doesn’t, frustrating to no end.

  I followed the instructions and only put in 5 sheets - and every few times I used it the paper jammed and would not back out - I spent hours with tweezers trying to remove the cut up shreads that were jammed in the shreader. It simply did not do what it needed to do- I had to return it

  I’ve had this shredder for two years and it worked great without an issue in auto mode, until i came home today and it was running by itself. At this time I hadn’t used the shredder in over a week. I don’t know for how long it was running before I got home but this could have become a fire because the battery in the lid was very hot. I emptied the can and ran some sheets to see if it was jammed but it never stopped running when on auto mode. If you have this make sure to leave it unplugged when you are not using it.

  This one seemed to be the cheaper one that works. If you are looking for simple shredding at home purposes, it is great. Don't expect it to shred more than 4-5 papers at once , because ti struggles. 2-3 papers at once is good.It overheats if we shred more papers(more than 40-50 pages in a row)The good part is it didn't break yet. It shreds fine and works good. So happy for the money spent

  I have shredded lots of things in my days. This is far from a commercial shredder; if you have a huge stack of items to go through you will probably overheat and ruin this thing. However, if you have things to shred here and there its a great product in my opinion. This thing is what it is. Don't try to stuff it or run it to hard like any shredder it will break. Make sure it is oiled if used relatively frequently. Overall very happy with this product.

  It works great for its intended purpose of shredding newspapers for compost (to go on my flower garden). It's also fun to shred up credit card offers and bills, both of which I've always been leery about putting out for recycling intact. I docked a star for its overly-small bin and narrow entry path. The entry slot can take a standard bill or sheet of printer paper fine, but I have to rip the newspaper in half before it'll go in. That's a bit of a pain, as is having to empty the bin way too often.

  Very disappointed with this shredder. The motor just died and it's been less than eight months since I bought it. I poured oil on the paper stuck in it and waited then turned it on but there was no sign of life and I looked for ways to open the shredder, but no. Other shredders I've owned in the past were a lot easier to fix. Not this one. I will not buy the Amazon brand again.

  If you're looking for a shredder to shred paper, with the occasional credit card, you have found a decent product to do so. It can handle the occasional ""stack"" of say 2-5 papers when needed. It even shredded the plastic window part of a paper envelope, going beyond advertised.At this time I have not used enough other paper shredders to determine whether this was the best or not, but I can easily say that it's probably not a bad one to use.

  If all you need to do is shred a few items at home and can stand the high-pitched squeak the machine emits, then go ahead and buy it – the price is right.  But if you want to shred a box or two of old tax returns or bank statements, get something stronger and quieter.  This machine is not up to the task.  And the wastepaper receptacle fills up way too fast.  Moreover, emptying it is a royal pain as you need to remove the top of the shredder.  My old Fellows shredder was a better workhorse

  Over the last few years I have purchased a couple of these shredders. I went with basics because I wanted to save some money since I would be only shredding junk mail. This unit (like the 1st) is complete garbage. It broke and will not turn on. I can’t believe I was foolish enough to buy a 2nd one for it to simply break again.Save your money and buy a better one. I wish I could shred this unit because it just shredded the money out of my wallet.

  One of the worst shredders I ever purchased. You have to be so careful because if you shred a couple pages and they don’t line up they end up folding a little and then it’s jammed. My husband has had to unjam the shredder three times and I just gave up on it completely.I returned it for a 12 sheet which is just as bad and unfortunately I am stuck with it.

  Bought to replace a Bonsai shredder that did not work at all.  Thankful that Amazon refunded the money for that shredder so I could purchase another one.  This Amazon Basics shredder is working great so far.  I also like the fact that it is easy to remove the top ""shredder"" part to empty the basket.  I was able to put a clear trash bag in the basket as our recycling here requires clear trash bags.  I am happy with this product & would recommend it.

  This is a great home cross cut shredder. It definitely does the job! The container is a little small for my needs since I tend to shred a lot at once. Also, I used to have a metal based container as opposed to plastic and this seems a bit flimsy to me but is holding up very well. Overall, I do recommend this shredder for those looking for a reasonably priced, home cross cut shredder.

  Have been using it for nearly 2 months and it works just fine. I don't use it every day and sometime have to use it pretty heavily. I would pay attention to the temperature of the electronics, and when it gets warm, I would stop and let it cool down a bit. So far so good and it is not like it getting warm quickly.

  After having it a few months, one day I used it for about 5 minutes and it just stopped working.  I unplugged it and cleaned it out and plugged it back in and it just would not work again.  I thought it was my outlet at first.  I felt to see if it was hot from overuse of (5 minutes) but it wasn't even warm.  I called the Customer Service and they said there is no replacement after 30 days. I had it since August 27, 2017.  It seemed like a lot of trouble to have to ship it to them to get it fixed.  They told me 10 working days so that could mean longer than that.  I was surprised that an Amazon product with their name stamped on it has only a replacement for just 30 days!

  I have been very happy with this little guy, have had no jamming issues and would highly recommend for moderate amounts of shredding.  I had a backlog of stuff because the crummy shredder I got from a local big box office store bit the dust last year, and this one held up well as I used it over a period of about 10 days straight for good portions of the day.  Now I just use it for daily stuff.  It is much quieter than a lot of shredders I've used and I really appreciate that I have not had to fight with it even once over undigested paper.

  I've always wanted a shredder and this thing is the best! Yes, it's kind of small, so you have to dump it regularly if you're using it all the time, but it works fabulously. I haven't had to deal with a jam yet because I'm real careful with it and I make sure not to put anything weird in the shredder. Also, it's important to not stack too many papers together when using it, which is standard for shredders of this size. I love it because it was easy to assemble and use instantly.

  I love that it does more than my little 2 page shredder, I've put through more than the 8 it states, but don't recommend it unless it is very small and quick to shred, or very easily shreddable (like onion paper)Noise is manageable.Safety features do add intended.Do wish that it ground / cut the paper more finely / smaller.  I'm concerned about my privacy as the cuts are still just large enough you can piece the info on it back together, such is why I'm shredding documents rather than snip w/scissors.If it wasn't for the large debris, I'd give this a solid 5 star.

  This shredder is small in structure but big in production, when it first arrived and I took it out of the box I thought that it was not going to be able to do some simple shredding. I had purchased a larger, very expensive shredder from Staples a few years ago and was under the assumption that in order for a shredder to do it's job it had to big and noisy.This little shredder doesn't cross shred as well as my old one, but I figure that if someone wants to try and piece together my shredded bank statements in order to steal the $12.00 I have in my account they can have at it, they need it more than I do. This shredder is GREAT, it does the job, and does not heat up and stop easily. (unlike my old one) I highly recommend this shredder for everyday household shredding jobs that need to be accomplished.

  This thing is like night and day with my old shredder! My old shredder took forever to shred and would leave pieces whole at times, jam sessions were frequent. We had built up a banker box of paper, mail, etc over the course of a year or so since no one wanted to use the old shredder. We shredded it all in about 2 hrs on and off, no jams no issues. Only wish would be that the bucket was a pullout vs having to take the shredder off the bin but for the price I’ll deal with it

  Adorable little guy for small jobs.I followed exact directions. Did not over work it and never attempted to shred more than 3 pages at a time. (Even though it says 6 is OK.)First took all the pages out of any of their envelopes and discarded those elsewhere.No need to put any bag inside the little trash receptacle as it is light weight and small, so very easy to dump out into large trash bag.Yes, this is tiny but perfect for private small household use.Had no problems with it at all and have ordered the oiled sheets to run through it when this job is finished.By they way, I do like the safer cross cut because the debris is so much smaller and therefore easier to destroy.

  Loud.  After about 3 weeks,it stopped working. I only used it to shred mail. Bank statements and about 4 credit cards. I would only feed it 1 sheet of paper at a time and and not very much stuff to shred. Before it got full of shredded paper it froze up and stopped working. I should of spent more money and bought a better one. The last one I had from Walmart cost me $50 lasted a few years, also for personal home use with just shredding of bank mail, hospital bills, any mail junk mail with personal info. On it. So not used very often. This shredder is junk. I could of used scissors to cut up the same amount of mail this thing shredded before it froze up and saved myself some money.

  Perfectly decent shredder for average home use. I can shred 6 pages at the same time without a problem. Credit cards shred singly without an issue (as expected they go slightly slower than paper... duh). The included lubricating/sharpening sheets were a nice inclusion.Real world stuff: I had quite a pile of old mail to sort (still in envelopes). I sat down, ""shucked"" the piece of mail, shredded the piece, and then on to the next piece to shuck then shred. With these pauses in between pieces I did not encounter any overheating issues nor automatic shut-off.

  This is my second time purchasing this paper shredder.  It is small and the chord attached is long (convenient).  It states you can put up to 10 pages at a time.  I don't recommend it, I find the one/two sheets does better.  I burned the motor up with my first purchase.  I love the way it shreds into small pieces instead of the long strands. The top is easily removed from the bottom basket to discard shredded paper. I have shredded the please purchase me credit cards (A+).  I will purchase again

  This is a smaller unit that is perfect for the occasional paper shredding. Easy to use, works well, has not jambed so far or overheated, doesn't take up much space. Keep in mind this is on the smaller side so if shredding often the basket will have to be emptied frequently as it does not hold that much. One thing I do not like is that to empty, the front can't just be pulled out like some bigger units (granted they are also more expensive). So I wind up lifting off the top to empty the basket and wind up with some shredded paper on the floor falling out of the top machine part.

  I'm disappointed with this purchase. This paper shredder struggles with 3 or 4 pieces of paper, and 6 pieces will jam it up and shut it down, every time. If you want a shredder that typically handles 1-3 sheets of paper at a time, this shredder will be OK. But if you want a shredder that truly can handle up to 6 pieces of paper at a time - don't believe the specs. It cannot handle what it says it can handle.

  Jammed in first week despite not putting in the maximum number of sheets.  Could not unjam it with reverse function.  Wound up putting cooking oil into it three times and finally using a knife to remove jam.  Currently will work but doesn’t shut off when on and no paper being shredded.  Developed a break in plastic housing where jam was but still runs.  The cross cutting feature is a good feature, very desirable.  It’s inexpensive but I expected it to be less fragile so long as I was careful on the number of sheets I fed.

  Great for the price. This shredder can handle standard household jobs. I purchased this for peace of mind disposing of unwanted credit card offers. I’ve owned it for over a month and have yet to find something it absolutely can’t shred. Beware of thick fancy textured envelopes, though. It swallows most mailers whole, but it takes some time “chewing” through densely packed, more elaborately packaged envelopes. I recommend opening and individually feeding those items to avoid prolong the lifespan of the blades and avoid overheating. Glad I bought this. Effective, not bulky, and well priced.

  This shredder lasted three and a half years before I killed it. Before this we had a much more expensive shredder that could only do about 4 sheets at a time. This one can handle a bit more, and has a powerful motor. Today... it bit the dust when I accidentally overloaded it, and it froze.

  After 1 year, the sensor stuck and it’s motor is on when you switch to auto mode, irrespective of paper presence. Lived with this annoying problem for a year, then suddenly it won’t do anything, either auto or reverse. That is it, two years, no more. Remember, home use is not heavy duty use. This is a junk just like any other.——- review immediately after purchase ——-Highly recommended by my boy. It is more powerful than my old and dying shredder, but frankly I don’t like the feed. It’s too small opening and at an angle, and such a small angle from level position. This is certainly not a well-thought design, but mechanically sound so far. No reliability data yet.

  I used to sneak my credit card offers, bills and other sensitive data into the shredder at my office. But my wife didn't like how it piled up before I would take it in, so I bit the bullet and bought a home shredder.This little guy works great. I had two grocery bags full of CC offers, medical correspondence, tax data, etc. that I was able to push through without stopping. The only thing is the 6-sheet rating may be a bit exaggerated. It had trouble with 5, but I guess that all depends on what your paper is.Shreds quickly, even goes through credit cards like it's nothing.My biggest concern is that it's difficult to tell how full the basket is - which was a problem when I decided to peek part way through my massive shredding job, and a confetti explosion happened in my living room. So my advice is to empty the basket regularly.The auto-sensor is nice because I can just leave it ""on"" and have it only shred when a sheet is fed into the shredder.It's been running well, and dropping a few pages into it each week has been easy. Overall, I'm very pleased.

  I have had this shredder since dec 14 of 2014 and finally, 2 days ago, on Jan 21 of 2018, it quit working. I have used this shredder to shred every piece of mail I have received or other important documents, on a regular basis and it worked awesome. The only downfall of this shredder is the constant jamming of paper. I was always very careful in making sure I put no more than 3 sheets each time and even then it would Jam. I had to unjam it using oil and I believe it stopped working on me is because my husband used baby oil since we ran out of the oil I use to use on the shredder. Overall, It worked perfectly as an identity theft deterrent for in home use or a small business use.

  UPDATE: I guess it just needed some time to cool down, so it wasn't really broken. Hence, I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2. If given a re-do I would purchase the Fellowes DS-3 10 Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder, but this will do for now. I'm on a grad school budget : )I received this item less than an hour ago and it stopped working.Maybe it's a lemon, I don't know but it's going back. I'm pretty surprised, given all the positive reviews. Here is how I used it, along with some tips and you can judge for yourself if this is what you want:- says 6 pcs of paper but it's really more like 2 pages. 3 max. With 3 pages, it starts to make that whining/ straining grinding noise that all shredders make when it's trying too hard, and/or about to jam- I shredded one or two pages at a time, in a continuous feed style- I was careful to put it in and feed the pages in alignment and jam up on right or left side of the feed slot- I centered all smaller sized pages (similar to the credit card feed slot that is directly in the middle) so aforementioned jamming would not occur- when the shreds got stuck in the shredding slots (more on this below), I would hold the shredder and bin together and gently shake it, so the paper pieces would settle on the bottom of the bin. Then I would reverse and turn off, then reverse again, similar to a blender, so the stuck pieces would unstick themselves.- When this wasn't enough, I would flip it over and pick out the pieces.Pros:- Low cost for criss-cross shredder (where else can you buy one for under $30?)- the reverse button automatically shuts off when the shredder and bin aren't connectedCons:- Heats up rather quickly- Shreds 3 pages max, not 6- May break very quickly (?)I would have given it 4-5 stars if it just lasted longer, like it's supposed to.

  Cons: The reviews said paper had to be put in just right - and that is correct - if not lined up perfectly, they won't be pulled into shredder.  Also, at about half full, it keeps shutting off saying bin is full.  It isn't - but paper does get caught at both edges and perhaps make the sensors feel like its full - then it keeps saying full every few minutes until it really is full - but that's after stopping and pulling stuck edges free and packing shreds down further. Also, VERY messy to empty - lots of paper ends up all over. Thinking about returning and perhaps looking for another one - not yet sure.Pros: fairly quiet, large bin, long run time

  I bought this shredder about 5 years ago for home use. I liked that it could shred credit cards in addition to paper. After about 6 months, however, the 'Auto' setting failed--instead of powering down when there is nothing in the feed, the power stayed on. I'm still able to use it, but decided to write this review after another AmazonBasics product (USB powered computer speakers) completely failed after 5 months.

  This may be a basic shredder, but it's a big improvement over my very basic old shredder (which I finally had to replace because it died after 18 years) because it shreds paper much finer than the old one did, and it shreds credit cards, which the old one wouldn't do.It's very easy to set up and use, but I'll just mention one thing for anyone who is as mechanically challenged as I am:  don't expect the shredder to start making a noise until you actually insert paper into it to shred. My old shredder started whirring as soon as I plugged it in, so when I plugged in the new one and turned the switch to auto/on and it didn't make any noise, I thought it wasn't working. I tried a few different outlets in case that was the problem, but still no sound. I finally decided to try inserting some paper, and was rewarded with a whirring sound and shredded paper. Duh!

  So far, works perfectly, shredding delicate documents into small, short strips and is not loud at all. All I hate is the switch at the all (set at ON-OFF-REVERSE). That switch is sometimes annoying when I am trying to turn it off, not accidentally on reverse. I wish a Power On button was there instead, THEN a switch for normal shredding and reverse would be fine. However, so far, so good.

  If you want an inexpensive shredder, this will do the job. I am disappointed with the cross-cut. The cross-cuts are too long and there are too many pieces that are cut length-wise but not cross-cut. I believe the 6 sheets capacity is for 20 lb or less copy paper. Don't expect to cut 6 sheets of statement paper,  the machine bogs down. There are much better cross-cut shredders available but they can be pricey. As the product title states ""AmazonBasics"" is exactly that.

  Very useful shredder. The crosscut feature leaves strips about 2 inches long which is perfectly fine for most home applications. However, those strips are long enough to leave name, address and social security number data intact if one is not careful in how the paper entering the shredder is oriented relative to the number, etc. A shredder that chops paper into tinier flakes would be more expensive but may be a better choice for those with more concerns over privacy. The bin is relatively small and needs frequent emptying. I prefer to reverse the feed briefly before shutting the shredder head off to empty the bin. That move reduces the amount of paper shreds spilled, I find. Credit cards and similar items are no problem but it will NOT shred a CD without jamming. Again, if you propose to shred computer discs, buy a more powerful unit. If I were on the design team for the manufacturer I would make two modifications. First, I would add a handle to the shredder head simply to facilitate removing it from the bin. My second modification would be a unit that stiffens the 3 or 4 inches of the power cord. I have found keeping the cord out of the way when replacing the head on the bin to be the most annoying issue with this shredder. A stiffener would help with that issue. All in all a super little shredder perfectly adequate for home use. It could be better but not by much and, for the money, it's hard to beat.

  I fed 3 to 4 sheets of paper at a time. Which it handled well, until the plastic , yes plastic, guide broke. Then paper would shred, but would build up at the side. I would have to stop regularly and remove the build up. Another guide broke later. I ran no CD's or credit cards. just paper.  Then the motor just died. This was a waste of money. I do not recommend this shredder.

  Just what I needed to quickly and efficiently shred a variety of daily junk mail and various documents containing sensitive information. The collection basket holds a significant amount of shredded paper before it needs to be emptied. The opening between the shredder and the container allows you to see how much paper has been shredded therefore you know when to empty the container The trouble shooting information is very helpful. My shredder became clogged and as instructed I poured some vegetable oil into the opening and waited 30 minutes. The problem was resolved.

  This shredder is functional, but has a very flawed design in taking out the shredded paper. In order to take the shredded paper out, you need to lift up the shredder. Not only it is inconvenient and a bit heavy, it also left many shredded pieces fall out while I am lifting it out. The previous shredder I have had a pull out waste basket without having to take out the shredder

  I bought this for normal shredding and to turn cardboard into compost. It ran smoothly for almost 2 hours of shredding cardboard cut down to around 32"" long and 6"" wide without overheating or jamming. I'm expecting to need to clean it out from time to time due to the glue used in cardboard manufacture, but I've got that figured out. This seems like a hardy shredder at a bargain price.

  The paper doesn't feed easily. It doesn't take 8 sheets of 20 lb. paper.  It jams easily with regular paper, even at 1-2 sheets at a time.  Constantly pulling stuck shreds at the end of the 3 minute time limit.  I knew this was a home shredder but come on....My last shredder lasted a good 10 years plus.  This lasted a few weeks until it jammed in the on position, constantly running.  Since most had a good experience with this shredder, I can only conclude this was a lemon!  VERY DISAPPOINTED! Returned.

  I purchased this shredder to replace one I had for several years, and am am very pleased with it. It does what a shredder is supposed to do, without any jams or other issues. I'm to paranoid to try shredding 8 sheets at a time, but I have done 6 without any difficulty. My previous shredder had trouble with credit cards, but this one shreds cards without any trouble. I would recommend it.

  Had a couple other brands and this is actually the quietest one so far.  Like the handle on the top part, makes it easy to lift off the top part.  Switch is backwards compared to the other units I have owned, ie. left to turn on, right for reverse mode - that took a little getting used to, but not really a big deal.  Have only had this for 6 or 8 weeks, but as long as it holds up, I'll be happy with it.

  If you have alot of documents, dont shred too many at once. My recomendtion is not more than 3 at a time. 1 if you are shredding a plastic card. (think preapproved credit card offer.) instead of shredding like the machines in the movie argo, when you see how the paper comes out, you tend to think, good luck putting THAT back together...if you have the occasional document to sred, It's not bad. My personal recommendation is to go the extra step and spread the disposal of the documents out over a few loads of trash collection. The only real mistake that cot extra was overnight shipping.When used as directed and occasionally cleaned out, This machine should perform for a LONG time. Just remember: fingers away from it, and turn off and unplug when cleaning out the rollers.

  Very unhappy. I have purchased this item 3 TIMES. The first time it was my fault I put a little too many pages and it got stuck and I could not get the paper out.The second I bought really just stopped working though I bought for our office and we don't shred much stuff and all of a sudden just stopped working. It won't do anything anymore.The third one I bought I have it at home to shred credit card offers and such and now when I set it on the 'auto' setting it won't stop so I have to turn it off every time because if not it will just keep running.The 2 stars is because when it did its job it did it pretty well but it only lasted less then 3 months.

  Having purchased many shredders, in my lifetime, I am very impressed with this shredder.  Although I originally preferred single strip shredders to make bedding for worm composting, since someone I hired to pet sit, allowed my worm composting bin to kill all worms by not feeding them.Anyway, I tried to take a chance at buying a crosscut shredder.  I couldn't be happier with it.  It has clogged only once and since the blades are exposed, it is very easy to rectify the problem.  (Unplug the shredder first.)I have put this shredder through some really tough treatment.  Once, the over heat sensor shut it down for a few minutes.  I do not constantly feed it six sheets at a time as when I do so, it really works hard to be able to take that many sheets at a time.  I recommend 4 at the most.I did spread one, old credit card.  It performed flawlessly.  This is a good match for my huge tumbling composter, along with a kitchen composting bin.

I just ordered another of the same exact unit to try it again be ause the price point is good and it got good reveiws..  So a follow up post will be coming.

  I purchased this shredder because of all the publicity about identity theft.  I now shred 10x's more than I used to.  All junk mail that comes in the mail with my name/address or personal info on it gets shredded.  Labels from delivery boxes, envelopes, etc. all get shredded.  I like the cross cut feature because I believe it gives another layer of protection.  So, it has only jammed once (due to my fault).  Good purchase at a reasonable price.

  This is my second Amazonbasics shredder.  They are built to last but I know from experience  you can abuse them to the point of failure.  It takes a few years but it's doable.  The minor faults the first unit had have been totally corrected.  The shredder is quiet!  The basket is easy to remove and slides back in very easily and there is an idiot light to remind you to empty the bin!  Definitely recommend for the home office.

  This thing is horrible is you have a large load. It keeps wrapping paper around on the left side, and even though I purchased a warranty - because it's under a year, I got lousy service calling Amazon basics customer service. The lady I spoke with was very nasty, wouldn't listen to what I was telling her on why it wasn't working right. Then she said she'd replace it, but I have to ship back at my expense.  For a $37 shredder - I'm not paying to ship it back. I'll chalk it up to a bad buying decision, but I would not buy this product.

  This is my first shredder. I pruchased it yesterday based on the Amazon brand value and it proved it to be worthy. I had a bulk of envelops accumulated for more than a year and the moment this shredder arrived home, I shred almost all of them in less than 30 mins. The shredder was in continuous operation but on and off in between the paper feed. It didn't overheat or shutoff. I liked the pace it takes the paper in. It was pretty fast. The cross cut size of paper is small enough not to leak any confidential information. The only issue I see so far is there are bits of papers stuck in between the shredder teeth which is not clean after the operation. But I think it eventually is going to drop in my next feed. Also the noise level is a little high. Overall this is a good product and I recommend worth a try.

  Shreds multiple pieces of paper (within reason) with ease.  I tried to shred a credit card with it, but the machine jammed; however, the reverse function ejected the card from the shredder.  Turns out the credit card had some kind of metal inside layer, couldn't even cut it with a pair of heavy-duty kitchen shears.  So kudos to the shredder for the ability to reverse out of a jam!  Highly recommended.

  I purchased this item in Feb. 2018 , after 6 months it would not work, after I called Amazon they said I needed the receipt in order to get warranty repairs which I could not find. They then told me I could send it back for repair but I was responsible for shipping and repair. After checking it out myself I found the plastic part of the trash can did not make contact with the safety switch. I repaired it and it worked for awhile however now it is completely dead.

  I was a bit hesitant with some of the reviews out there but let me share my experience. Found five years of old utilities, benefits and insurance documents that I needed to destroy. I would clear out a folder then shred what was not needed. I was able to do this for 2 hours with no overheat issues. I wasn't going super fast but it was a pretty good pace.  The light came on and after 30 minutes I was able to jump back into it and do another hour of shredding. The overheat light never came on. Would highly recommend!!! 6 pages may be a stretch as I found four pages or less worked optimally.

  This shredder gets an A+ rating from me!I wanted a shredder to shred personal documents and cross cut was the best way to go, at least for an at-home job. I have sacks of papers to shred since I cleaned out my files and there isn't any place in town that does shredding. I checked Amazon and this one came up.I've had it for awhile now and have yet to have it shut down because of overheating or jam because too many pages were thread through. I've even shredded unopened envelopes without a problem.  I've had shredders at work that cost a lot more than this one that didn't do near as good a job. Yes, I'm talking brand names.Although I don't see having to replace this shredder any time soon, when I do it will be with another one just like.

  Great little shredder for light duty home use. Just be aware that if you run it continuously for a long period of time it will overheat and shut down. I was shredding a several inch high stack of paper that I had set aside waiting for the shredders arrival and I ran it for over an hour straight. It finally shut itself down. If you just wait for a while for it to cool off it will start working again. I also would advise to not push the 6 sheet limit. Some paper stock is much heavier than others so if you are shredding heavy paper, don't try 6 sheets. Now that I have made it through that big stack this shredder will easily handle the occasional few sheets that a normal day should bring. Good price, good little shredder. Don't forget shredder oil.

  A lot quieter then I thought it would be. Works amazing, we are not shredding papers for too long but we do have a decent amount of papers to shred. Normally I use it for 30 minutes or less at a time but I have used it for up to an hour straight and it hasn’t over heated on me yet. Handles credit card no problem as well as 12-14 sheets at a time. I never really like to max out my electronics if I can help it but for normal use it’s definitely great!

  The paper shredder really comfortably shreds 4 sheets of paper rather than 6.  Every once in a while you have to reverse the shredder to clear paper shreds that get stuck in the blades.  You also have to physically pick out stuck pieces of paper and be careful not to cut your fingertips on the blades.  It's gotten stuck a few times when I've inserted 6 sheets of paper, and then I played tug-of-war to get the sheets out along with reversing the flow...eventually it came out, but with frustration.  The product works fine for the cost so long as you don't put more than 4 sheets of paper in to shred...and keep it aligned while it eats the paper, otherwise the paper folds on itself, and you have double the paper sheets on the edges.

  It's quieter than my old shredder that recently bit the dust.  It seems to work fine but in my opinion the paper cuts are are too big.  Easy to make out information if someone actually tried to piece things together.  Odds are that no one is going to but,  since the idea is to shred personal information to make it illegible,  I would not say this fits my expectations as a secure product.

  Been using this for a month already. No hiccups; easy to use. Also get the lubricating sheets AmazonBasics sells to maintain it. I honestly don’t know why the instruction manual mentions using oil to lubricate the machine and doesn’t mention the lubricating sheets, since AmazonBasics sells them. Oh well, their lost...Oh, it also is loud (unfortunately I haven’t tested other shredders to compare it to), so maybe invest in a pair of ear protection muffs (less than $20 on Amazon) if you plan on shredding a lot. You’ll thank me when you’re older that you got to keep your hearing ;)

  We've owned shredders before, and have always been disappointed with the purchase.1.  This shredder is very quiet, which was a pleasant surprise.2.  This thing is a beast.  I purposely tried to get it to go into a cool down cycle, but it never happened.  Between my wife and I, we spent 5 hours shredding documents.  No problem at all.3.  The unit has caster wheels, but is light enough to pick up and carry.4.  It is NOT a fast shredder.5.  The feeding area can be a little tricky at first.  But ince you get used to it, not a problem.

  Wow! LOVE IT! Pretty impressed- came RIGHT away- maybe even one day! Came ready to go- so easy- plugged in and started using it. It got jammed once because we stuck thick envelope and then something else same time- silly of us- then we reversed it and shut it off and it started working again. It is easy to dump, very small - maybe the size of like a small kitchen garbage can (not the size of a medium and not the size of an extra small one you see in bathrooms- in between).It is perfect for home use- probably not good for big offices- just for me when I pay bills etc. It fits right next to me, nice long cord, black and streamline- they did a great job here. I mean really.Does credit cards too!If you have college age kids- buy them one and ship it to school (tell them to be careful not to get finger or hair stuck etc.) First thing I did was teach my 10 year old how to use it- even though I won't let her- in case she sees it behind my back and tries (as she does other items in house). I wanted her to know exactly how to use it in case. She has a healthy fear now.

  This has worked well for about 6 months so far.  It handles several sheets of paper or envelopes at once with no problem.  It has had no trouble with credit cards either.  Occasionally it will jam if one of the kids feeds it too much, but the paper is easily cleared.  There's no reason to spend more IMO.

  I am very pleased with this shredder. It meets the requirements for my working from home. It sits in a corner until I need it, then rolls very easily on the tile to the closest outlet. Easy to empty. My one concern is the very remote possibility that if you store it where children could access it, they could figure out how to feed the power cord into the shredder and shred it.

  The machine works well when used as intended - lightly and infrequently.  - Beware to put only 1 - 3 sheets of paper at any time. If you have an 8.5"" x 11"" sheet and do not place it carefully, edges will fold, creating double the width.  - The motor is not intended to be used for extended periods of time. Shredding for about 3 minutes will strain it's limits. If you tend to stack up and shred all at once, consider a higher powered (read: more costly) machine or be prepared to take your time. Run for about 3 minutes and give the motor another 3 - 5 minutes rest before continuing so the motor has time to cool.

  This handles heavy duty shredding for much less than other brands.  It easily can handle shredding 15 sheets at once.  It is a bit loud but not excessive.  The toggle buttons to shred/turn off/reverse are a bit clunky but it does the job I needed it to do.

  It’s a cross cut paper shredder. Not complicated. Keep it to 8 sheets or less. Respect that card stock counts as 5 sheets and watch it go. I cleared a large pile of receipts and other docs 10 minutes at a time in no time at all. Mostly I do this in the morning while the coffee is brewing. It’s easy and sort of satisfying to watch them get chewed into confetti.

  I took a chance on buying a product like this from Amazon because you don't really know if it will work well or do what you need it to do.

  I contacted Amazon on Feb. 28 via chat about the failure of the motor in this product, and requested someone higher up contact me after a dismal exchange with a slacker chat rep. Still waiting. I will not buy an Amazon branded product again,as this is a lesser quality for the money than the one I should have purchased. The motor stopped working twice, not from overheating, not from overloading, it just stopped working when I shredded three store receipts! I did not receive a warranty card in the packet of documents, which I still have in the original plastic bag, and so was told they cannot help me. Clearly my purchase record is in my account and the rep knew it was still under warranty. I want either this product repaired or replaced. I only use it two or three times a month, for home use. I bought it April 2018. Shame on Amazon for not standing behind their own branded products. I buy a lot off Amazon, also for my office, but this was the first Amazon branded product and will be the last unless Amazon makes this right. Its been almost a month since I requested help and my guess is that this so-called customer service rep did not bother to move my request up the line. He doesn't belong in customer service in my opinion.

  I got my shredder just in time for the end of the year paperwork clear out. The shredder worked well for up to 6 sheets of paper and cuts the pages into small bits. I found it easiest to stuff the pages in folded in half as the opening is wide enough to put a whole sheet in but just barely. With the pull of the wheels the paper tends together dragged to one side or the other. My concern was it may jam it up. However since this isn't an industrial strength shedder I am still most happy with its performance. I'm very happy with the price and performance of this shredder.

  I had a bunch of documents to clean up and decided to get this cross-cut shredder instead of my old straight cut one. After less than 5 minutes of use, I got the first ""overheated"" issue. The machine just shut down without any warning. I couldn't find out what's going on so I just let it sit for 10 minutes and then it cooled down and came back to life. And then, another 5 minutes, it shut down again. That is VERY ANNOYING. I knew I had a lots of papers to shred but that shouldn't be any issues - every 5 minutes to wait for another 10-15 minutes of cool down time is not okay! I had to switch between my old machine and this new one (while waiting for it to cool down) so I could finish my shredding job.The pros of this machine, I have to be fair, is that the price is cheap and it does the cross-cut function right.Now since I cleaned up my batch of shredding, I will not accumulate too much to do at once. With less to shred, I assume it will not get over-heating too much or too often. I'm going to give it another chance before I return it. We will see.

That said... after using it for a few minutes, it's clear that this is a sturdy/quality product.  I was able to get through mountains of old bills in no time.  This product is much better built than my previous $100+ shredder.

  My old strip shredder died and I ordered this one. I love that I got it in 2 days and didn't build up a big back log of stuff to shred. At first I was disappointment about how small the catch basin is but the cross cut shredding takes much less room and more paper is in this small basin than went into the larger one on the strip shredder, Only complaint is that it really does not like more than two sheets at a time, It shreds but slowly and the motor complains while doing it. I suspect heavy use would wear it out very quickly but it is perfect for my home use.

  The shredder was great- when it worked. It would stop after ten minutes of use and would often return to functioning after twenty- four hours. Within a month of this behavior, it stopped working entirely. Three months late- I was about to toss it- it began to work again. But I had to hit it with my palm first. I don't know why, but it worked. Until it didn't. I think if you use it once a week, say for your average mail delivery, you might be okay for a longer period of time, but if you want to use it to shred annual documents, i.e. you no longer need them for taxes, then its not the shredder for you.

  After 2 years it finally died.  I still give it 5 stars because I put it through the ringer.  In addition to the normal bank documents and anything with personal information on it I also I shred a lot of cardboard (thanks Amazon!), brown packing paper, and non-color ink paper to go into my compost bin.After 2 years of heavy use the motor finally gave out on me.  It happened when I was doing a big run of brown paper and I didn't allot for cool down time so it may have even lasted longer than this if I didn't push it so hard.If you're just looking for a standard home use shredder, this thing can't be beat.  I'll probably be picking up another one just because the price is so good and I bet I can get the next one to last even longer with a little added TLC.

The device is what it says it is - basic - and with that in mind it deserves 5 stars. It consists of a removable shredder head that sits on top of a wastebasket. The head has a handle so you can lift it off and empty the wastebasket. There is a narrow slit under the handle where the paper goes, which is a nice design because it means the shredding mechanism is inaccessible to little fingers.It is smarter than it looks, because if you put the head on backwards the machine recognizes the misfit and won't operate. It also has a heat sensor. A couple of times the light came on and the machine refused to do anything until it cooled down. That's a nice feature because it will prevent the motor from burning out. It was lighter than I expected. Along the way I came across an expired credit card and shredded that as well.This device is billed as an 8-sheet shredder, but I wouldn't push it. It strains noticeably with 8 sheets, and I fed it 2 to 4 sheets at a time. If you really need to be able to shred that much at a time for long periods, get a bigger model.

  I bought the more expensive shredder for home use.  We didn't have a lot of things to shred and used it exactly three times for about a half hour each.  The shredder is only about two weeks old.  Then it just stopped working.  We let it sit for a while to see if it just needed to cool off but there is no power at all.  Very disappointing.  Then when I started a return it said that we have to pay freight to return it even though it's obviously defective.  It is heavy and I can't imagine what it will cost to return it.  Don't waste your money on this shredder.

  This shredder did not get anywhere near my expectations. It overheats and clogs up even with less than the advertised 6-sheet capacity. After less than two months 'gentle' use it only operates on one side. After talking to their customer service I was told to unclog it by picking the clogged paper from the shredder. Dhurr !!!! This I had already done........ it still only shreds maximum three sheets at a time for a limited number before it overheats and stops for 30 minutes. Now waiting for the Customer service to offer money back or a new  shredder in the hope that this was a lemon.

  Much smaller than I expected.  When they say 6 sheets, they mean it, no more.  With 6 sheets of standard printer paper, it bogs down and sounds like its about to stop.  When it jams, and it will, its almost impossible to get the jam out.  The cross cut leaves larger pieces of paper than I would like.  After shredding about 30 pages, it overheated.  Have to wait 30 mins before continuing.  Would not buy again.

  Great for personal junk mail or other documents that need destroying.  Order the Fellowes Performance Oil to keep in lubey; not lubricating the metal teeth can cause this thing to break, I guess, and if you aren't squirtin' juice in there the warranty will be voided.*note: I am dumb and ignored instructions to only put paper material in, and wanted to see what it'd do with a semi-plastic envelope.  Clogged immediately.  I was able to (after unplugging) pull out all the plastic and get it going again, but.. yeah... only paper. :)

  I work from home and this is perfect for destroying documents such as bills, personal information etc.  the cross shredding makes it basically impossible to put the pages back together again.  The one issue I have is that after a few years when I have it in ""automatic"" mode it continues to run even after it finished shredding the pages.  I have the oil the recommended to keep it lubed up and that doesn't help.  So now I just use the on / off feature.  But it's a GREAT shredder for the price.

  It looked bigger in the picture.  It's not pocket size, but smaller.  Perfect for a small office space in your home, doesn't take up a lot of space.  Added a medium garbage bag for paper collection and plugged it in.  Fed it 5 sheets at once right off the get-go and it worked fine.  It does not have a drawer to pull out to empty, so you have to remove the power head/cutter to perform this function.  Not a big deal, but the power head sits very snug into the can.  The power head has a built in hand hold to pull it up and away which automatically turns off the unit.  No need to unplug while cleaning the can out.  Good and handy unit, didn't regret it.

  It's a typical light duty shredder. It overheats and shuts down for a while after a few dozen passes. That can mean a couple hundred sheets of paper, 5-6 at a time, or a few dozen sealed envelopes. Don't expect it to last for years and years before the sensor gives out, but most low end shredders don't.The unit is remarkably similar to the units you'll find at $40-60 at a typical office supply store. You can think of it as incentive to get Amazon Prime, as it's only a bargain if you get free shipping or if it saves you a special trip to the office supply store.Of note, this is a cross cut shredder, not a confetti shredder. With strips that are about 1.5 inches long, that puts it between strip and confetti shredders. The shreddings aren't as compact as with a confetti shredder, and you can't mix these strips in with cat litter or otherwise repurpose the shreddings as easily as with a confetti shredder. Amazon does have a confetti shredder for a bit more that also allows longer shredding sessions without overheating. Consider that if you want to get creative with recycling or if you'll be doing heavier loads. But if all you're after is shredding the occasional bank mailing or credit card, this unit will suit you well.

  It is small, not heavy. I was able to shred a fair amount of papers before i had to clear out the bin. Sometimes it just stops shredding, so I turn it off, put it in reverse mode, pull out the paper that is stuck in there, and then go back to shredding mode. so far so good. I have had this for 1 month or so. I have use it for 5-15mins on a given day, say 1x/week. I have not tried shredding ATM cards. I have never had the too hot sign light up so I wonder if that is why the shredder stops shredding sometimes, but within 2 secs, it is shredding again. I have used the associated shredder lubricant paper - I have not owned a shredder before to say that it is needed or not, but it was recommended. Seems sort of economical. Would I buy this again and/or recommend it - at this stage of ownership yes to both questions.

  I was surprised at the price of the products, but it was well worth it for a good price. Amazon Basics products are a really good brand. This has a reverse and forward button to slide. You can lock it. It's easy to physically take the top off by moving it to empty contents out. It look like a mini trash can, so it blends in well with the room. I've used it a couple of times so far and it hasnt broke, even on hard cased credit cards.

  I had an older and larger model 12 page cross cut amazonbasics clearview shredder that I retired for this one. Just got it today and it operates smoothly, takes less room, and costs less than a replacement of the other. I really love the new design that enables me to lift the shredder assembly vertically to discard the shreds. Its lighter weight is a real plus, too. I am very happy with it.

  Ordered certified amazon warehouse deal. The producer arrived with a section of the can broken. This particular section depresses the safety feature on the shredder that allows it to run. As you can see in the photos , I had to modify the bin in order to make it work. Does anyone look at the condition of items before sending out?

  For the cost, I am relatively satisfied. This is being advertised as an 8 sheet capacity shredder. In reality, it can handle 3-4 sheets of uncoated 20lb matte printer paper at a time without making a high whining sound and smelling like the motor is overworking itself. I also had to take frequent breaks as it overheated regularly. I had a 5"" stack of papers to shred and was expecting to take a few breaks, but I was forced to take over ten breaks lasting at least ten minutes each so that the shredder could cool down again. Also, when I tried to shred 6 sheets, the shredder jammed and would not reverse and I spent over 40 minutes fixing this issue.

  This paper is heavy duty, and seems like it will last a long time. It does a pretty good job shredding but sometimes I can see a whole line of text. I still think it’s a good shredder though compared to the last one I had, which could only do eight sheets max. I also wish that it was not necessary to completely remove the top of the shredder to empty the bin.

  I bought this item during October 2019.  I took reasonable care with it, oiled it frequently and did not overload it.  A week ago I put in what was ironically a Chase Prime credit card that had been replaced and it seized up.  As far as I can tell without taking it apart some of the gears in the head must be stripped.  The motor turns it I insert a paper but the shredding wheels to not turn.  I am very disapointed.

  I had a ton of documents around the house that needed to be shredded, however I didn't have a shredder. I decided to get on the internet and review some shredders that were budget friendly. I found this paper shredder on a blog and decided to go ahead and purchase. For the price I figured I wouldn't be out that much money if it decided to quit working.It arrived in perfect condition and on time. It is a decent size shredder that also has a credit card slot so you can shred those. Due to the amount of documents I needed to shred I expected it to overheat or quit at some point. It didn't do either! I went through about 4 crates of documents and this didn't jam or heat up.This shredder is definitely worth the money if you have some light or moderate shredding to do around the house. The cross cut shredding is great and gives you some added protection. I didn't even know that Amazon had their own products but this one is definitely worth looking at if you need a shredder. The two day shipping is awesome too if you have prime and need it pretty quick.

  This shredder is great for the money! Very quiet, shreds through everything with ease. Large enough, 6 gallon basket and appropriate alarm lights, make it very user friendly. For instance, it tells you when the basket is not in place, or full!! Very nice!! Highly recommended!! Buy the oily papers too: they help with the smooth operation especially before a big shredding task!

  I've owned this for three months and I've used it a lot...including a ""file cleaning day"" that put it through it's paces.  So far it's just as good or better than the last  two Fellowes I've owned. Their blades always seemed to bend easily and they would run on forever. For $35 this was a real bargain. I have a small business and would highly recommend it.Update 7/11/19  This still works very well for me.  I have never had any problems with it. It looks like the price has only gone up slightly in 2 years so it's still a great bargain.

  I say max 10 months because I just discovered it’s not working and I use it very infrequently.  Looking now and see the bin is about 1/4 full.  That’s all the paper I’ve ever shredded in this.  No credit cards although I was excited to try that and realized it’s completely dead.  Now I have this giant paperweight under my desk that’s going to into a landfill and will pollute the earth for the rest of its life.  You’re not saving money with this product because you will need a new one soon.  Just get a real brand not Amazon junk.

  I purchased this simple paper shredder for home use, mostly to shred mail with my identity on it.  After only 3 months of light use it died.  Only the reverse direction operates.  I have oiled it with the suggested lubricant 3 times prior to this, rarely shred more than 2-3 pages at once.  I am annoyed as my previous shredder lasted several years.  Amazon Basic products are cheap as this is the level of quality, also.

  After receiving this shredder, I used it to shred a foot-high stack of papers I've been collecting for some time.  The stack was gone quickly, and not once did the shredder jam or overheat.  Although info  about the machine says it can take 12 sheets at a time, I never fed it more than 6-7 sheets at a time and generally let it rest for a moment or two between batches.  I used this cautious approach based on negative experiences I've had with other home shredders.  So far this seems like a very solid machine, strongly recommend!

  Had to use an extension cord to get this behind my desk which was more trouble than I wanted. It shreds fine and it's relatively quiet. I had one before that took about 20 pages at a time and was 'always on'. So I miss that. If this one hold up, though, it will do just fine. My old one lasted for over 10 years but it was also very expensive. We shall see how it goes....

  Does the job as advertised. It heats up quickly if you're doing big bulks of papers. I had a box full of letter and bills from about 20 years and that took me a few hours every day for about 3 or 4 days, because after filling the bucket maybe twice it would get hot and I had to let it cool down for half hour to restart the process. I means this was a special situation. I can't see anyone shredding this much paper at home. For that you would gat a more professional one. Since then, it works perfect. I do maybe a couple of letters at time maybe a credit card here and there and it works wonderfully. So I recommend it.PS: Remember when doing big bulks of paper, if you feed more than 6 sheets at a time it will stop working and you might need to use the reverse button or let it cool down. Also after 15-20 minutes of intense work it might stop work till you let it cool down. Cool down time is usually 30 min.

  Great shredder at a great price for home use. Does a nice job of shedding (it's actually more like die cutting) paper into 1/4""x1-1/2"" rectangles. Obviously not designed for all day, every day office use, but perfect for lower demand, personal shredding. It does shred 8 pages at once, as advertised, but it seems to run much more energetically at 4 or 5 sheets at a time. I suspect that feeding fewer sheets than maximum will extend the life of the machine, and I wouldn't call this a negative, just a choice. It's also easy to run some shredder oil through the intake slot every so often, as recommended. I've been using it 2 or 3 times a week for about 2 months and it seems like a good solid product.

  Have used this shredder a lot now.  This is a very simple to use but powerful & great shredder.  The motor weighs a ton and is beefy;  it can grind through more than the rated 8 sheets.  There is no pull out door or wheels or anything like that.  The shredder motor is set into the basket below and you plug it in.  Simple.  Surprisingly, it also has an overheat LED as a warning in case the motor is getting too hot.  Thankfully, we have not seen than warning yet.  Amazon Basics and Jeff Bezos come through again!

This thing isn’t light, it’s got some weight to it, it’s noisy every time you pass anything through it but it’s so worth it. It shreds credit cards too.

  Shredder jammed and stopped running on first use, while feeding five sheets of paper (limit is six). Returned for a replacement, and the replacement did the exact same thing. The issue seems to be that the paper is hard to feed straight, and if gets pulled in at angle, the paper bunches and the shredder jams, even when following the limits for number of sheets. I was looking for a budget shredder for lightweight household use and thought this would suffice, but it really isn't worth the headache of returns. Spend a few bucks more for something that will actually last beyond one use.

A paper shredder isn't a very ""sexy"" household item, so there's aren't amazing things to say about it, but it's a good device to have, and this one does its job well.I have definitely pushed its limits; feeding paper that was tri-folded, envelopes with those ""credit cards"", doing more than 8 sheets.

  I returned this item immediately after discovering the basket was not removable.

  Lightweight plastic bin / bottom, but then, I don’t plan on using it as a motorcycle ramp for Evel Knievel style jumps, so, serves the purpose – a trash bin. The top/shredder is sturdy, has off/on and reverse. Was the best shredder I could find in this price range and it works as advertised. It’s not industrial strength but for home/home office use it does the job.I know the description states it’s a cross-cut shredder, but I’m always a little skeptical of just how well they perform until I get a chance to use one.

  I purchased this shredder in February 2016.  Within a week, I had to return it for a replacement as it was defective..  All throughout my use of this machine, my husband would work on it to ""unclog"" it.  I never put as many layers as it said was able to shred.  One could only shred for a short amount of time before it would ""shut down"" until it cooled down.  Not worth the money or frustration.

  Originally purchased one of these shredders in February of 2015 and it served me well for shredding receipts, documents and junk mail. After a recent power outage and subsequent surge when the power came back on it apparently bit the dust, (it had a 1 year warranty, though I'm obviously far past that) but for the $30 I paid for it I'm happy with the 3½+ years of moderate use I got out of it.Ordered a new one in November of 2018 and found a nice little design change that they've made in the new version is the addition of an LED next to the power switch which stays green under normal use but changes to red when the unit overheats under heavier usage. (and one would assume returns to green after it cools down again, though I haven't stressed it enough to find out yet)TL;DR: It's a shredder, it's cheap, it works.

  Paper clutter has been the bane of my existence and I decided to purchase this with some holiday gifts I had received. Let me tell you what, most cathartic adulting gift I've every purchased. There is no thrill like shredding old credit card statements, okay maybe its just me but it handled a full half day of random shedding like a champ. I've only put a few pieces in at a time and a few old credit cards individually but everything has shredded gloriously. I've impressed with what a good job shredding it does, nothing left but paper confetti!

  I will admit this is my first Amazon Basics purchase, and I was a little bit leery about buying it. I thought about buying a different brand that was more expensive because I wasn't sure how great Amazon would be at making a shredder, I mean I love their kindles, but a shredder isn't really something I associate Amazon with. When it arrived I was excited because I had a pile of stuff that needed shredded including credit cards. There is literally no set up to this thing, just set the top on top of the trash can thing and go, that's it.I tried the credit card shredded area (its a spot in the middle) first, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well and quick it worked. I also tried out varying thicknesses of paper as well, I wouldn't recommend more than 3 pages thick, but it does its job and really quick. It is a tad on the noisy side (more so with plastic cards then with paper), but I was expecting that a shredder was going to make some noise. I am really glad I bought this shredder and in the future will be trying out more Amazon Basics products.

I have yet to be disappointed with the AmazonBasics products.I bought this to do an epic shredding of years of paperwork and it handled it all very well. No issues at all: it does take a break when it gets to hot, which is also a signal that you're pushing it too hard. I fed 6-8 sheets nearly continuously; I used some light oil on the cutters too - makes a difference.  So while I thought I would just use it massively this time, I've decided to keep it under my desk (it is small and discrete enough) that I'll shred as I go, as opposed to marathon shredding events. I'm sure the machine will appreciate it also.

  After almost ten years, my old paper shredder finally gave up the ghost, so I decided to try and find a new model. I was a bit suspicious of this Amazon model since it comes up as the number one rated product under office shredders, but most of the reviews appear genuine, so I decided to roll the dice.My unit came a week later and after unboxing, I immediately flipped the on switch and sent in six sheets of credit card offers. (Probably 75% of all my mail is more enticement offers from those sh!t heads. Is it any wonder the world's forests are growing smaller?) Gratifyingly, those credit card offers were ripped to shreds before my very eyes, ....six pages at a time. Exactly as advertised for this model. I then broke out a few of my outdated club cards and sent a few of them through the shredder, and they were destroyed as well.Are there any downsides to this unit? Only one; the power switch on top is a bit loose, which might be a point of concern as the years pass. Other than that, and so far, this unit is five stars.

  This is the first paper shredder I have ever owned... so I don't know if its just me or the unit but man is this thing kinda loud when its activated... I mean, I don't have kids that are sleeping in the next room or anything like that so it doesn't matter to me too much but it took me by surprise when I took it out for a test-shred. I love how it shreds old credit cards and ID cards that you no longer use. Some only shred paper, this one shreds both! I have not tried CD's yet and I'm going to consult the owners manual again before I try that because I don't want bust it. Other than that, it does what its suppose to. I'd buy it again!

  I really like this shredder so far.  It performs as advertised and is easy to figure out.  However, I wish the shredder portion didn't lift off the base so easily -- there should be a way to clip it to the bin.  If you want to use it intermittently and put it away when not in use, it's very hard to move around without the top shredder part coming off the bin base.

  Read the reviews and took a gamble on this because of the price. I have shred a lot of things with this machine. My top piece of advice would be to not shred too much at once. All shredders aren't meant to run for a long time. I think that some paper is caught in the blades because when it pulls paper in, it pulls to one side, which causes the page to fold over and become more difficult to shred. Overall, this works well. It had no problems with credit cards. I use it almost daily to shred mostly junk mail- no major documents. I think that's the best use for this machine; occasional use for small documents.

  Although the website states it can shred 6 pages, it really doesn't. Not without a few paper jams at the very minimum. The machine does shred, you just gotta be patient with shredding 2-3 pages at a time rather than the 6 that it advertises. The machine also made me a professional shredder jam troubleshooter - so thank you for that. For the price point, I guess I can't complain.

  After en extensive and long overdue cleaning of the basement, I bought this to shred any and all documents with sensitive info. I was not patient enough to go one sheet at a time, like my previous shredder required. I was test long 4, 5 even 6 pages at once for extended periods with no lag or overheating. Pleasantly satisfied with the little machine.

  DO NOT BUY!!! this shredder broke within one month. It just stopped shredding papers..i am attempting to return it and it has become even more of a process. amazon offered me ups pick up which i selected. i then went to schedule the pick up and ups wanted to charge me 11.00.. after spending 5 minutes trying to find the contact  us button the website. i went with the chat now button.  I explained the above to the rep and she then told me i wasn't supposed to be charged. however i do need to be home. What is the point of ups pick up if you have to be home? perhaps amazon should tell customers this when they choose this option. After 5 minutes trying to solve this issue i will now go and drop it off. perhaps amazon should work on its return options. a shredder should not break after a month and it should be easy to return.

  I was frustrated by a cheap $30-$40 shredder with a 6 or 8 page capacity that was slow and constantly overheating.  It would not even run for 10 minutes before overheating making me have to stop and let it cool down.  I finally decided to spend the money for a better quality one.  I wish I had done this a long time ago.  In the few weeks I have been using this one the hours of time I have saved have paid for it many times over.  It shreds through a dozen or more pages at a time with no problem and just as importantly it has not overheated on me even once after going through reams and reams of paper.  The larger bin is a bonus plus it runs a little quieter than my old one.  It's still loud but the difference is definitely noticeable.

  I used the shredder once and it never turned back on after that. I tried everything from cleaning every speck of paper out to repositioning. The machine is simply defective or garbage. But based on the reviews, there's a large batch of these that don't work. I guess I'll be making a trip to Staples smh

  I am so glad I bought it!  During COVID-19, I am home all day and working on organizing.  This shredder has helped so much with getting rid of so much paper for me!  I even used to to shred temporary license plates that were on my new car.  Once I got my permanent plates, I did not know what to do with the still-valid temporaries, and so I just shredded them for my protection.  No jams at all...handles old credit cards like a dream, too!

  Not a bad little shredder. I bought primarily on price, and, although this isn't what I would call cheap . . . it cost less relative to other brands/models and these days it feels like a shredder is a household necessity. I am an amazon fan, so was happy to try their brand. On first use (when I had LOTS of backlog to shred), it overheated frequently and I had to stop and wait for about 1/2 hour each time for it to cool. (I don't foresee that being an ongoing problem because I won't always have the backlog of items to shred.) I also have to say that it doesn't really shred ""6 sheets"" at a time, but it can zip right through 2 pages, which is fine for my needs (mostly bills and direct mail). It does have a middle section (about the width of the short end of a credit card) and that area worked fine to shred credit cards. The full width can only really handle 2 (maybe 3) pages at a time without slowing or jamming.

  I read a TON of reviews on LOTS of shredders before choosing this one.  I knew it was going to be smaller than the one I'm used to at work, but being that this was for my home (and I have limited space), that was fine with me.  I mainly chose it because of the no jamming testimonies.  The first day I used it (withing just a couple of minutes), the paper jammed.  I wasn't putting in multiple sheets because I was afraid of it jamming.  I think the paper might have gone in sideways, and after some very careful pulling of the strips of paper that were stuck (make sure you unplug your machine before trying to clear a jam!) it finally cleared and I haven't had any problems with it since!  And I've used it A LOT!!!  I am very happy with this purchase!

  I was hesitant to buy another shredder after my last TWO died after maybe a month or so. The thing is, I only shred the junk mail and credit card offers my husband and I get. Very little use in the long run. However, I’ve had this for a few months now and have shredded  PILES of the junk that had been accumulating- and it’s still going strong. Very good shredder and I love that it’s a crosscut it makes a great addition to my compost pile haha

  Great product.  The cutting head weighs at least twice that of my last shredder, which I believe was brand named 'Jam-o-matic.'  It would jam with a single piece of paper.  And I couldn't even think about shredding a credit card.  This one has a smaller basket, but it holds more shredded paper because of the cross-cutting action, which lets the shredded paper pack into the basket better..  The cutting heads are much beefier and I don't think I'll be having problems with this one.  I've had this one a week and it is working fine - my wife has decided that its time for us to reduce, reduce, reduce, which means a lot of old bills, records, papers, etc., will be shredded in the next couple of weeks.  If problems develop I'll update the review.I believe it should be sold with a small container of shredder oil.  Instructions say to use shredder oil or canola oil, but none is included.  I deducted one star.I would recommend this for a light-duty shredder for a homeowner.

  I honestly didn't expect it to be so small buuut it does it's job. It works perfectly and I find it best to only shred 3-4 pieces of paper to be safe. Any more can make it difficult and jam. This is not meant to shred so much for so long, after maybe 30mins it will overheat and a red light will come on indicating it needs to cool down and will not continue to shred. Worth the buy

  Would not buy this shredder, it definitely does not take 8 sheets of paper.  I used it a total of three times.  The first time overheating light kept lighting up. Second time would only take 1 pierce of paper.  Third time just cut off and would not come back on.  Outside of the return window!NO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHREDDER!!Money wasted

  6-sheet? probably less. first time i used it got stuck. it worked fine the first few minutes but then stopped and i have to carefully clean it and started to work again. i can only recommended if you do little shredding like receipts, letters (page by page)  and no more than 5 pages. I did no try credit card yet.UPDATE: this shredder stopped working a few weeks ago. In the past used to stop when probably it was to hot but later restarted. I tried to open it to check if there was something stuck or a fuse need to be replaced but I couldn't open it. Two screws were like stuck. I clean it, removed small pieces of paper but still not working. I will give it one more try by trying to open it and if it does not work I will throw it away.

  Upon arrival, I put this shredder to the test. It has two outcomes, to perform or perish. I will not own a less than a stress free appliance. I sent everything that would fit (and was recommended) down the hatch., it shredded without effort and did not overheat after continuous load for 15 minutes. It survived my testing. Next is longevity which I am unable to comment on as I have only had it a couple of days.

  After about 7 months' use, this shredder started jamming up after only a few papers. It's supposed to be able to shred 8 at a time and now it only shreds one at a time. After 3 pages, it slows down and shuts down completely after 7 pages. I hit reverse. Then I have to open it up and pick the shred lumps out. It appears that the shred is being sucked back into the shredder instead of falling harmlessly into the receptacle. I emptied the receptacle frequently so make sure that wasn't the problem. It is basically useless now. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it worked great for the first few months.

  Little but mighty.  I was replacing my original shredder that lasted for several years.  This one shreds more paper copies at one time, and has a powerful shredder.  It has a decent waste compartment that is detachable from the motor.  My only complaint is that the slot is smaller than my previous machine, & the on/off switch is awkward.  It is well worth the money.

  It is just what we need for home use. It fits nicely in a small space we have in the kitchen (where we open mail and pay bills) at the end of the cabinets, before the wall. It's completely out of site. There's an outlet, so we never have to move it. It shreds like a beast. I also purchased the sharpening and lubricating papers. I ordered Sunday and it arrived Tuesday afternoon without so much as a ding in the shipping box. Amazon comes through again! Off the subject, I'm equally happy with prices being lowered at Whole Foods subsequent to being purchased by Amazon. I hope more items will be included (items in the refrigerated section and more produce.)Do not hesitate to order this item if it's for home use.

  Terrible product. Used it once a month and the third time I used it, it would not process the paper through. I had to throw out a shredder I used successfully twice, so frustrating! I made sure to only put a couple of regular thickness papers through at a time, followed all directions for care, and stored properly.

  This one will work for me so I am keeping it However the cut is much larger than I expected. The machine looks good, solid fitting and nicely built. I have no problem with the way it runs it's just that I got the cross cutting one thinking it would be hard to read the individual letters and that is not the case. After shredding something you have all kinds of clear individual letters in the can. I am keeping it because I like everything else about it and if you either do a lot at one time or wait before emptying it so you have a lot of different papers it would be almost impossible to reconstruct any of them. I use this for home regular use, it would not be suitable for use if you needed a lot of security.

  Today was my first time using this and it has shut down three times in less than 2 hours and it smells like it is over heating or something like that.  It cools down in about 15-20 minutes and starts back but that's aggravating as I have a lot of stuff to shred.  Oh well, I'll have to work with it and hopefully I won't ever have a lot of paper to shred again.Update:  05/18/2015 - I have upgraded this review because for whatever the reason, this little shredder is no longer cutting off and I shredded for well over 8 hours getting 6 bags worth of paper.  (It took 8 hours because I was constantly opening envelops, removing glossy colored papers, removing staples, discarding any plastics and also got sidetracked by looking old pictures and reading old correspondence.  I realize that I can shred some of the stuff that was removed, but I'm shredding for compost and that stuff should be avoided for that purpose.)

  This is a good shredder. works as expected. 2 negatives that keep it from getting 5 stars.The feed rate is considerably slower than I am accustomed to. I don't know the 'inches per minute' speed but it is definitely slower than my old one from Staples. The other this is the paper slot, very close to 8.5"" wide (like copier paper) , paper will not go in if not perfectly aligned.

  I got this for less because it had ""cosmetic damage""  The bottom side of the waste can was dented in so badly it didn't sit flat on the floor.  I used the auto body trick of heating the dent with a hairdryer and bumping the dent back out.  The shredder itself is fantastic!  I zipped through my pile (3 garbage bags) of papers, newspaper and cardboard in record time.  I thought it was quiet for a paper shredder. A very good deal!

  Used this shredder for light household use.  It frequently jammed and would overheat quickly when I tried to shred numerous papers (like the 2 times I cleaned out my filing cabinet in the last year.)  It said it would shred 6 sheets but if you tried to put 5-6 sheets in it, it would bog down.  Could only do 2-3 at a time and it still jammed.  If you're only EVER going to shred 1 piece of paper at a time, this is probably a good buy.  If you may have times where you have a shredding party or need to shred multiple pages at a time, look elsewhere.

  We were using this just for household mail. Didn’t put more than a couple of sheets in at a time. Then for no reason, the grabber mechanism stopped pulling the paper in. Of course this was just barely outside the 60 day return window. We thought maybe we’d leave it unplugged a bit and check later. Now it won’t even turn on. Thanks for wasting my $45, Amazon.

  This shredder is a very basic model.  It's twice or more as light as the one it replaced.  It's really only good for paper and if you put more than 6 sheets of paper in it (not 12 as advertised) it will slow it down and cause it to work a lot harder.  Make sure you remove any staples from the paper before shredding.  It is easy to use and empty the container.  So far so good.  I've only had it for about 4 months.

  The unit is listed as a crosscut. The true definition of a crosscut is ""squares/rectangles, not great than 1/4"" this is not the case with this unit. Shreads are 1+ inch long by 1/8 in. wide. That should be noted in the description. It was not.

  Update- Nov 2018: this thing is still going. It got stuck a few days ago when I put too much paper in. I spent about half an hour trying to free the mashed paper using reverse and working out the bits to no avail. Then I poured a small amount of vegetable oil across the shredder and let it run with a new piece of paper and it works just great. Seems like I just need you to be lubricatedJuly 2017: This shredder is great for mail/home use. Due to low capacity, I wouldn't use it for home business or work but I keep it hidden by the couch and shred all those danged credit card offers that come daily while I'm watching TV. It's not overly loud and handles a few pages or a credit card with no problem.

  I bought this shredder for my dad last year. He was sure he needed one. As dads sometimes do, he overestimated his need. He's only had to empty the bucket once.Unfortuantely the shredder has not held up. He called me today asking for help. The motor turns on when the sensors detect paper, but it doesn't pull the paper in to be shredded. I'm guessing that the gears have become stripped out. So I guess I'm out of luck.

  The shredder is much quieter than our old Fellows shredder, a big plus.  The two minor flaws are these: [#1] When arrived, the box was dented and the plastic head of the shredder (housing the motor and cutters) had some cracks and small pieces of plastic broken off. Not damaged enough to return, but still.  [#2] The shredder does not make ""clean"" slices i.e. when cutting, say, five sheets at once, the crosscuts are crimped on one side and the five crosscuts are crimped and held together like a 5-layer cake.  With my old Fellows shredder all the crosscutted pieces would fall apart.  Maybe the cutters got slightly misaligned during shipping (see [#1]). Again not worth returning as it does what I want.  I have done much shredding and this shredder seems to be a workhorse.

  We had a shredder several years ago and had not replaced it until now. This shredder has been used for several hours already. We have shredded for about 2 hours straight without overheating or any issues. This shredder is relatively loud, but not too loud. I just turned up the television and watched TV while shredding a large stack of paper. Side not: if you are packing up fragile objects the shredded paper works great instead of using bubble wrap.

  Works like a charm and takes a lot of papers at one time.Easy to clean too. Doesn't get gummed up from credit cards, however, it recommends putting only one credit card in at a time.  I did that and it worked perfectly without clogging up.  It also takes staples without a problem.  The write-up said it will also take paper clips but I haven't tried that.  I can easily take off the paper clip from the paper and there is no need to try putting it through the machine.  I have been very satisfied with this machine.

  For me my old shredder was existing beyond its useful life.  It was constantly jamming with just three sheets of paper and I had to constantly unjam the machine while cursing all the time.  In fact the paper was not really shredded; all I had was clumps of paper which in fact could be read.  Time to look for another more competent and easy to use shredder! As I did my search for a useful shredder which can handle more than three sheets of paper no muss, no fuss I hoped to find a machine which would not cost an arm and a leg.  Finally  I found the AmazonBasics  6 Sheet Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder.  Being brand new I found that this shredder eagerly ate up 6 sheets of paper very efficiently.  Also the shredding of the plastic credit card was done with ease.  Also be aware that the shredded paper and plastic completely destroys all recognizable print. The shredder is highly economical and provides the security one seeks in using such an apparatus.  Highly recommended!

  This is my first AmazonBasics purchase and I could not be happier. Item was shipped quickly as usual and was well packaged. Shredder fits tightly on the waste basket and operates like a dream. Quickly shreds papers into tiny slivers, almost like confetti. One feature I like is how well-balanced it is. The previous shedder I owned had a tendency to tip over easily because it was top-heavy, but I haven't had that problem with this product. Shredder is easy to use and has a sleek, sharp design. Great price.Quick update: I've been using this shredder for several days now to shred years of old paper work. It's works perfectly. I do recommend using an oil with the shredder, something I mistakenly did not do with my previous shredder. It truly helps. I suspect this machine is going to last much longer than my previous shredder because of it.

  If you are a serious cat like me, no home-office should be without a shredder.In particular, I enjoy shredding envelopes and junk mail. Keeping your desk and office space tidy is fun when you can shred!Careful not to blindly stuff it with a handful of papers or it will jam. Five papers thick, max, for smooth operating.This shredder will not handle a handful of paper like a pro. If you are looking for that, think about spending an easy $100+The redeeming quality of this one is that it is affordable and works if you respect it!

  I bought this unit in late 2015.  It is now early 2020 and the auto-shutoff feature no longer works.  In other words, once it's finished shredding something, it just runs and runs indefinitely.  The only way to shut it off is by manually flipping the power switch.  This is inconvenient and annoying to do.  Maybe 4-5 years is considered a long time for these to last, but to me, this is average reliability at best.  Before this malfunction, the shredder worked great.  3 stars for malfunctioning much sooner than I believe is reasonable.

  I bought this in January (it is now June) and used it maybe 2-3 times a month.  It was at 2am one morning in the last week of May that I was awoken to a sound which I couldn't recognize.  I walked into my home office to find this shredder was running non-stop.  I turned it off and went back to bed.  The next day I spent an hour cleaning it and trying to get the auto shred switch to work again, but no joy.  It now only works as a manual on/off switch which means it runs non-stop while shredding a pile of papers... which also means it gets very hot during that time and I have to take a break.  Would have been nice if it lasted.

  Used it for 1st time and the right side wont shred paper. Like if I put and envelope on right side it doesn't register any thing is there. If I put a full size sheet of paper it will shed on both side. But right side alone doesn't register anything is there.I was shedding less than 6 papers at once, as it claims it can handle, becuase 6 normal papers get jammed and u have to reverse shredder and do 3-4 at one time. I used the lubricant sheets to see if that would help right work, no luck.Cheap product.

  Works well for my home use. However, product claims it can shred 6 sheets at a time- it CAN do this, it just makes very angry noises when it does. I found that 3 sheets at a time is the real maximum this little shredder can happily handle. First use I had a large box of junk mail I'd been saving up for a few months that needed to be destroyed. Took about 2 hours because I gave the machine breaks every few minutes so that it didn't overheat. Overall happy with purchase so far.(9-15-19j Just an update: I’ve had this shredder for almost 3 years and it’s still working great! Still only doing 3 sheets at a time and give it breaks when shredding a lot of things.

  Originally, I bought a Honeywell shredder and it broke after a day. This Amazon Basics is so much better. It is very powerful and I was able to shred 50 pages in a couple of minutes with no problem. Very easy to use. There are just two pieces - a garbage pail and the actual shredder. Just put the shredder on the pail, plug it in and you're good to go.

  Replacing a worn out home shredder, I researched for the best while also looking for the cheapest. This is not the cheapest but was very worth a little additional money for the quality. It will pay for itself in longevity without repair or replacement in another year. Very quiet, will handle 15 sheets, large capacity bin, on rollers so it can be moved easily. I highly recommend this particular model.

  The shredder was bought in September 2019, didn’t start using until the November 2019, jammed and did not function as of December 2019 after one month of occasional use. Tried troubleshooting according to the instructions to no avail. Tried to contact AmazonBasics Customer Service but connected to a message saying that business hours are Monday through Friday from 8 am - 5 pm PST and to call back during regular business hours. It is currently 1 pm PST on a Friday! Their contact us form doesn’t work (possibly not compatible with an iPhone), I input my 10 digit number to be told that I must input a 10 digit number. The reason I was trying to reach them is that I tried fixing the shredder again, only to notice that there’s rust on the blades. With one month of occasional use. Horrible quality control and worse customer service. Save your money and time and buy a better shredder.

  I'm that kinda person that as soon as I get mail I would throw into a shipping box or some kind of container. Fast forward nearly ten years of collecting mail and files into a closet full of packed to the brim boxes. I bought this shredder to take on this job, I been meaning to get around to it but as I'm sitting here about 70-75% done I've had one small problem. It did get jammed once but that might have been due to trying to get done quicker. I've maybe tried to get 8 sheets in at a time. Did seem to struggle a bit but it managed. It's always safer to stick to about 5 sheets. I've never had it overheat but just now I did feel it getting warmer. It does help that I'm doing this while binging on Netflix so as to get a nice continuous flow of shredding. Pause every so often. As I stated earlier, nearly a decade worth of paper, for me that might translate to four average size garbage bags. Managed this at about a stretch of 2 days. Take that information as you will. Very satisfied with this investment.

  Nothing to dislike with this compact shredder. It is strong, fast, and simple to use and empty.  Motor runs and sounds like it could  easily handle more than the stated 8 sheets, but have not tried that. It is smaller than my old Staples unit, which I like, as it saves space in my home office.  It is a great shredder for letters, envelopes, junk mail etc.  The price is great for a home office unit.  Under $40.00!

  It’s loud but does the job I only put one piece of paper at a time doesn’t do many pages I’m afraid it will jam it. It stop working a few months now I’ve been trying to return it don’t have the original box finally called to get a replacement I must return the shredder to have them fix it it will cost me more the $20.90 to return it this is too much money to return something that never work the right way since the beginning.

  I was happy to have a new shredder until I assembled it. The device is extremely top heavy. The shredder top weighs 11.5 pounds and is awkward to handle. To remove the shredded papers, you must lift off the heavy shredder. The basket has a very small capacity. I wish I had not chosen this shredder. It is awkward to use and makes a mess when you need to remove the basket. Do not choose this shredder.

  I not typically write reviews, HOWEVER, this shredder has earned my trust. So we have been working on cleaning out a family members house that was deeply hoarded with papers to the max!!! We were using a 2 sheet max cross cut shredder that was on its last leg. I was skeptical about using amazon products but I thought I’d give this I try. Without a shadow of a doubt this shredder is a savior. This thing cuts and shreds more than hydroxycut. This thing puts the hulk to shame. And better yet so this thing tells you when it’s full!! I don’t even tell my man when I’m full!!! Nonetheless I’ll probably get 6 more because these are incredible

  For the price you cant ask for more. This shredder is solid and handles all kinds of shredding. I jammed it with 9 pages so dont try to go beyond the specified limit. My only complaint theres no light when the shredder is on(or status light) like on previous cheaper versions, which seems like a safety concern. Otherwise everything checks out.

  I have been using this product for over a year now and it still works! Before this one I bought one (more expensive) in Big Lots and had to return it after a few weeks of use. So i'm happy with the durability of the product.CONS:Sometimes it can get stuck but its fixablewont take more than 3 empty envelopes at the same time (when adding the 4th one it usually gets stuck)So for beter use you actually need to shred one to 3 papers at a time. But considering the price, I will say this works pretty decently!.I did not receive any discount or anything. I bought it myself and I'm happy with the product.Click the button if this review helped you at all :)

  Paper jams in center part of shredder, requiring using a dental pick to clear the jam of paper wrapped around the roller.  Shredder seems dead when this happens, but once paper is cleared will run again.  This problem has recurred multiple times, despite careful use and keeping within the limits of number of pages it can shred.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 of these shredders at same time, and problem occurred in both of them.  Just outside the warranty period, so had to toss both of these.  While it worked, worked great, but can't recommend to others.

  Purchased roughly nine months ago.  On/off switch stopped working over the weekend.  Amazon sent a replacement within days.  The switch may be 'under-engineered', otherwise a great shredder for the home office.  Would be five stars otherwise.  Larger than typical receptacle for shredded paper.  Easy to empty.  Unlike my previous 'name-brand' shredder this Amazon-branded product has never gotten hot in use.

  This paper shredder is perfect for small spaces. I bought it for my home office, I will go paper-free this year and will have a lot of shredding to do. It works great. I do not remember if it shreds staples because I automatically take them off no matter what. That paper shredder is perfect for small scale tasks and does a good job. I highly recommend it.

  This is a shredder on casters that I use in a home setting, mainly for shredding up names and addresses on mail and other documents that are not kept, so I can't speak for how it would run in an office setting.  No doubt, it could handle a much higher level of use than I am using it for.  There are five indicator lights on top:  bin full, door open, over load, over heat, power on.  The slide control switch is labeled:  Rev - Auto - Off - Fwd.  The bin has a large capacity.

  My old shredder was on it's last legs, so I ordered this as it had good reviews. My old shredder said it could shred twice as many pages as this, but I never put more than about half a dozen sheets in at a time. It was my second shredder. I normally do a big shred session every year, but decided it would be better to shred the papers more often, I think it's kinder on the machine, I don't like to overheat it.When I put the old one out with the garbage after it finally kicked the bucket, it had shreds of paper still in the blades I could not remove. I love this shredder, when it has finished shredding, I slide the button to reverse and all the sheds that didn't drop down the first time, quickly dropped down completely, leaving the the blades shred free. I really like that feature. It sits on top of a bucket type container, unlike the last one which slid out.At first I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't hold as much as the old one, but now I'm shredding more often, and keeping on top of it, it's not a problem. I would buy this shredder again.

  Worked awesomely. I have had this shredded since June 2018. It's now January 2020 and it has died. I had very few paper jams that were easily solved with the reverse switch.  Great for small/single households with minor shredding needs. If you purchase this, go ahead and BUY THE WARRANTY. It gets 4 stars only because it only worked for less than 2 years. I'm about to upgrade.

  I've been wanting to get a new paper shredder for some time now, since the one I have is not that great.  I got this one because it's a Cross-Cut cutter and it was a good price.  I received this shredder before the due date.  It was delivered 4 day's before I expected.  I thought that it was much bigger than pictured, but it only stands about a foot high with the shredder on top of the basket you'll get with it.  It works real good, so far.  Shredding 6 sheets of paper will just about stall out the motorso I only do no more than 3 at a time.  It depends on the thickness of the paper your shredding.  The shredded paper comes out in small pieces, so there is no chance of them being pieced back together!  Don't forget to oil the cutters with Vegetable Oil.  Read the instructions.

  We are only occasional shredders, so we didn't go for one of the top of the line units out there these days.  As you can see in the description this shredder is not free, so we did have the expectation that it would hold up to our light use.  We were wrong.  This shredder stopped working before we ever needed to empty the bin.  What a disappointment.  Don't buy this product.

  This item made it through 2 papers and 1 credit card before it broke.  Sending 2nd credit card through it got stuck and would not reverse it back out.  Had to return item with half of my credit card still in machine!  Lame and would not recommend. Had another shredder with same function for 10 years and just quit on me.  Will go back to the Embassy brand!

  This shredder is the same as other shredders shredding credit cards.Not for cutting credit cards, it only cuts deep but not completely and if it does cut it will only shred diagonally,if a credit card is shredded diagonally take a  look at the pieces  and you will see  all the info is still visible only in strips,i found this true in other shredders too.Scissors are still the way to go

  Just received it and set it up - super easy. It's extremely top heavy, a small bump would send it toppling over potentially damaging the motor/blade portion and creating a big mess. It operates fine for now, but the one we had before (it was their 12 sheet shredder) is a lot sturdier and easier to move around. Should get the job done, but it's definitely a budget shredder.

  I like that it shreds paper and credit cards. you can't feed a bunch of papers at once but I did not buy a commercial shredder. It is not super quiet but isn't horribly loud either. For the price a decent product. if you don't have stacks of paper to shred this will work fine. If you do, you will have to take a little time to do so. It will get the job done!

  I have a paper shredder that looks exactly like this one from a different brand and after about five years of use, it has stopped working. As much as I would like a sleeker and more powerful shredder it is not in the budget. I am discovering more and more Amazon basics items lately and I am pleased to say that the shredder is another pretty decent product from Amazon. As I said it looks exactly like the shredder I have been using except it has an Amazon basics logo on it. So far it is shredding very nicely and is just going to be used for basic mail shredding at home so I didn't really need anything more than this. The size is just right so that I don't have to empty it all the time and a grocery bag fits very nicely into the container so that you can just toss out the bag of papers and replace it with a new plastic bag each time. Again very happy with the purchase for now. Glad it comes with a one-year limited warranty, even though I have not checked what that warranty includes.

  I love this little machine! It works so well, it's light weight, so easy to use, easy to clean. Perfect size, not too big or small. I used this for an hour straight and it did not overheat and worked perfectly the whole time. It's also fun to use, especially shredding cards! Just be sure to follow the guidelines and this should last a long time. So glad I finally got a shredder!

  After having to clear several jams (and ensuring I was careful not to put more than the recommended amount of sheets in at a time), I was using the shredder and heard a ""pop"".  When I investigated, it seemed like a piece in the inside of the unit had broken off and I could hear it rattling around inside the unit.  I returned it with no problem.

  Love this little shredder. I saw similar shredders at Staples, but this one is sturdier, better constructed and seems to be a heavier duty model than anything I've seen elsewhere. It's also cheaper on Amazon. Good instructions and easy to set up. I like that it has a credit card shredder. It can be used to shred any plastic ""card"" - from old membership cards, to debit cards, gift cards etc. So much junk mail arrives with a plastic ""membership"" card with my name etc. on it, I feel better just shredding those even if they aren't ""live.""

  great low-cost unit. Don't overload it - I used a limit of 4 pages, and kept it lubricated, and it is working fine even with extensive usage.6-months+ update:It is now mid-January 2018, and I still love it. The church shredder went out, and I took this to them until they could get one. I have shredded perhaps the equivalent of a 25-foot stack of 8.5 x 11 paper since the Summer 2017 purchase. Still very pleased, and still observing my lower-than-specified limit of product going through the teeth. Would definitely buy again (and use my limits!).

  Our Shredder died and I was left scrambling to find one when I realized how expensive they could be. I've been extremely happy with Amazon brand items so I thought I would give this a try as the price is slightly cheaper of some name-brand shredders. It's actually much more quiet than our previous Shredder, shreds papers very smoothly and without jamming and is designed the same as any other Shredder. Looks great and does a job so I'm happy!

  I have two problems with this shredder. The first is that the shredded pieces are too big. I had a shredder for 20 years that made much smaller pieces. Smaller is better when shredding. My second complaint is that the opening for the paper is too narrow. Yes, it handles the paper size it says it handles. But there is no room to spare so you need to feed the paper very carefully. If it was just 1 inch wider it would be SO much easier to use.

  I have owned a couple of paper shredders over the years and this one so far has been one of the best. I use it to shred mail with personal info, credit cards, and personal/ legal documents with ease.The items you run into the machine are diagonally cross cut instead of the straight line cutting (pictures attached). Anyone with time on their hands can sit down and place all of your straight line cut documents back together which is why I recommend you stick to the diagonally cross cut feature at the least - which this one offers. Micro-cutting is the ultimate feature to have. Six pages at a time is no problem. If you do happen to jam it or it slows down because you added to many pages at one time it does have a reverse switch. It also has a safety feature that only allows the shredder to work when it is properly placed on the can - safety for yourself and your kids. Highly recommend this!

  I do a lot of shredding of confidential papers. I have gone through a lot of Staples shredders. This small, non-commercial shredder is the best I have used. As long as you don't overload it, 5 sheets max, it works fine. Per the instructions I add a little vegetable  oil every time I use it.  At $1 per per pound for confidential shredding, this thing has paid for itself a hundred times over already.

  If you need a shredder for anything more than casual use do NOT buy this one.  After 9 years, my freebee with purchase shredder finally died -- and it had worked a lot harder, longer and much more quietly than this one.  Since prices seem to be doing nothing but going up while quality goes down, I will probably spend a lot more money on the replacement and hope for better results.I am learning not to trust Amazon products for longevity.  Shredder dies at 25 months..  1st Kindle died at 26 months.. 2nd kindle made it to 30 months (I read a lot).. Mouse died at 36 months..

  Replaced my old 3 sheet strip shredder. Wow what a difference! This easily gobbles up 5 or 6 sheets at a time, even folded material goes right through. 7+ sheets will go in but unit slows a bit and no reason to test absolute maximum capacity for household shredding. If doing repetitive job it is good to slip through an old greeting card or other heavier stock to clear out the gears. Love the crosscut, virtually impossible to reconstruct shredded bits. Unit has a 2 minute overload feature but we've run it for over 10 minutes continuously and it did not overheat or shut down. Nice job!

  Easy to replace and Diy it. This is maybe an oem iphone 6s screen replacement,but it works  just like the original one, screen seems as bright as my rose gold screen.The screen is  fully assembled except for the home button. The video for the product clearly explains the  process and all of the tools are included. Just make sure you have a good clean surface to  work on because the screws in the phone are speck-of-dust sized.the new screen itself works  as described. No color issues, no function issues. I will definitely use this product again  and recomend it to my friends if they need.Tips:1. You should remark every screws for each is different,put it back to original hole.  2. You should read the pdf instructions they email you,it tells how to avoid damage.  2. Watch the install video step by step if you are a new hand.

  This is decent value for the money, but over time, gunk accumulates in front of the optical sensor (triggered when you have it switched to ""auto"") so that it never stops, which kind of defeats the purpose of automatic mode.It's not particularly hard to clean it out -- remove the four screws holding the shredder top together, pry it open a bit to get a decent-sized gap, and then blow the area in front of the sensor clean with some compressed air or electronics dust-off. This is now the second time in as many weeks and the fourth time so far that I've had to do this -- a better sensor path design would greatly improve what is an otherwise cheap and valuable piece of hardware for the home office.

  This shredder offers great quality for the price.  It's a bit smaller than I expected, but the compact design doesn't take up much space.  For home or small office use it's ideal.The built-in handle is a nice feature that makes emptying the basket easier and the front window on the basket lets you see when it's getting full.  The top motor/cutter assembly is quite heavy (a good thing) and it's surprisingly quiet in operation.  The great reviews are well-deserved and I feel comfortable knowing that Amazon stands behind their products.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

  This is a simple shredder with basic functions and it performs quite well. A maximum of 6 pages can be shredded at a time per instruction manual but the shredder seems to have a bit of difficulty if more than 3 pages are fed at once. Cross-cutting is definitely a nice feature. It is also nice that the bin is made of solid plastic; my previous shredder had a mesh metal bin and dust particles flew everywhere whenever in use. Shredding produces a noise that is louder than expected; the noise actually has startled my 3-yr old son. The feeder opening is a bit wider than I'd like; little fingers and objects can certainly fit and touch the blades. Caution should be exercised whenever using the shredder (as with any machines). It probably is not a bad idea to have the shredder in a discrete place or unplug it when not in use, especially if you have small children and/or pet at home. Overall, this is the perfect shredder for home! It is nice that this is delivered in frustration-free packaging.

  I had purchased a smaller, less expensive shredder but found that I got what I paid for; long strips of easy to ready paper and always stopping in the middle of shredding. So this time I was more careful and it paid off. This shredder cross cuts the small paper strips, has more room for the shredded paper, is pretty quite, and moves around easily. Was well worth the price (so far)

  Update - not so impressed any longer. Had to return due to motor stopped working and locking up. Never went above requirements for shredding as it never could go beyond 5 sheets anyways. Amazon sent a new one (which I was grateful) and after one month, the same thing happened. I was encouraged by reviews but them learned about filtering out just ""verified purchases"" and saw differently. Returned for refund.Very impressed with this small shredder. I wouldn't say it does 8 sheets at one time but I have put unopened junk mail and it shredded perfectly. Credit cards go through smoothly.

  Small but tough and powerful.

We had to shred a couple of decades of voluminous tax records and it's still as good as new.Highly recommended.

  Does just what it says, cross-cut shreds paper. I received this AmazonBasics 6-sheet shredder on Saturday and spent all day shredding a years worth of credit card mailers and other documents. Not once did it overheat or sputter. I did take care to oil it properly before the first use, in the middle of this marathon shredding session, and before I put it away. Normally, I would only oil it every three-six months but due to sheer volume I figured it was a good idea.The reason I had such a backlog of documents to shred was that after my old one kicked the bucket, I couldn't find a reasonably priced, average-use shredder. AmazonBasics to the rescue! I've purchased their cords and never been disappointed. The only AmazonBasics product that has ever disappointed is their flat television antenna. It just didn't do the same job the Mohu Leaf did. Of course they promptly refunded my purchase after I returned the item.Packaging was perfect on this shredder, snug and without waste. Tip: the plastic bag around the bin is of course the perfect fitting trash bag. Total product utilization :)

  I used it (with short breaks) with a fan blowing on it for about an hour and a half and it was an awesome little workhorse. Super efficient, really does take 8 pages and does credit cards without flinching.The other reviews are spot on, however, in saying that if you wanted a tighter, smaller cross cut, this is not the machine for you as the shreds come out about an inch or so long.  My only other criticism is that the shreds do often get stuck in the machine - if you continue to shred paper, it's not an issue.  But if you're a stickler and like to clean it free from debris...it's going to make you angry :)

  It shreds. It is a little slow to start when you first insert paper and it runs on for an extra several seconds once the paper is shredded. But, the important thing is that it has no problem shredding multiple pages or credit cards, CDs, etc. The window in the catch basket is a nice touch as it lets you see how full it is. Overall, I am very satisfied with this item,

  It may claim to shred 6 pages at a time, but I do not recommend more than 2 as it starts screaming and slows way down.  I also have had to clean out the shredder blades a few times due to the paper jamming and clogging the blades.As a personal choice, I will use this shredder until it dies but I have no love or respect for it and will not buy the same one again.

  I figured this would be a full size wastebasket size shredder for my office. Nope. This is tiny. It it’s more of a desktop shredder for a few sheets of paper and credit cards. It will overheat after a few bills. Not worth the money get a bigger one.

  Bought 4 years ago for $29.99. It worked well for about three years. It still works now, but the auto setting is defective. Basically if on auto, the machine runs constantly. Not safe! I am able to still use the shredder by turning it off after each use. Definitely a nuisance, but not enough for me to shell out $38 for a new machine.

  This is ok shredder.  It is not a 6 paper one though if you put four sheets in it then it will starts to struggle to the point you think its going to break.  So be mindful don't leave it plugged in motor burs out don't put more then three papers motor burns out.

  So far so good. Not the best but pretty decent. Best thing I found out so far about this unit, it eats junk mail without having to open it, do you realize what a time saver that is? Just be sure it is not super thick. I no longer open those annoying credit card offers or any other junk mail, just feed in right into this unit and enjoy the mayhem.

  The title says it all. So far I've put about half a ream of paper through this shredder. It's very quick, sharp, relatively quiet, and only stopped because of the heat once. I think I can get many years of use out of it so long as I can shred a little at a time and not have to go through three feet of paper in a month.

  Ordered this shredder to have at home for small shred jobs. Was excited to get it and try it out, but when I opened the package I discovered the bin was cracked on the side. The bin is a lightweight plastic like a garbage bin. Unfortunately I did not get to test out the shredder as I put it back in it’s packaging and out in for a return as soon as I saw the crack. I should be receiving replacement  shredder in the upcoming week. Hopefully that one won’t be cracked I will update my review when I receive the new product.

  I bought this from Amazon Warehouse Deals, and it came with shredded paper and plastic already in the teeth.  I figured that's just what I get for saving some money on someone elses return... and tried it out anyway.  It was then that I realized there was a jam. I requested a return/refund, but because I need to ship it back, I wanted to get my half-shredded items out of it first.  After I finally thought I had cleared the jam, I plugged it in to run my paper thru forward or reverse, and the product started smoking and caught on fire.  That's the only reason I'm leaving the review.  You should be able to correct a jam and move on, not have the whole thing catch.  I've ordered a new 12 sheet version and I'm hoping that I will have positive things to say when the smoke clears.Gotta love Amazon though.

  Need a powerhouse shredder? Order this AmazonBasics shredder now. I have been scanning documents, and then shredding the papers and recycling them to get rid of the stacks of paper I have held onto through several moves. No more. With the AmazonBasics shredder, I have been able to get rid of confidential documents in a secure manner and have significantly lightened my load. It's fast, easy to use, and easy to empty the shreddings with the pull-out bin. We love it.

  There is no setup whatsoever. I started testing it right out of the box, it worked and I am keeping it.  This is for my home-office use, I don't need a super good shredder.. My search criteria were fast, can shred paper without removing clip, can shred credit card and the alike.  This one is perfect and price is right!

  This device is darned near a tank. I shredded so many papers over a two day period when we were moving a few months ago that you would swear the old apartment was an Enron satellite office.It does get warm and need a break from time to time.It took a lot of (unintentional) punishment from me and almost caught fire when I got the feed jammed. Luckily, I was able to clear the jam without the loss of fingers (thanks Amazon for those safety features!) and finish shredding everything.So no fire and loss of fingers.Win/Win!

  I’ll be honest, I’m not good at paperwork and filing. I let papers pile up before I bother getting rid of things I don’t need. This shredder is loud but it shreds several papers at once. I will admit that if you need to shred for a longer period of time (30 minutes) it does tend to get hot and a safety feature turns it off until it can cool down.

  Unlike other product, I don't have any reference or idea while purchasing a paper shredder. Therefore, I think I should give AmazonBasics a try since I saw this brand a lot everywhere. I have been using this shredder after I got it, and I did find some good and bad for this product.Pros:*Is very good for house using because it can only shredded 6 sheet at a time.*You don't have to worry about the staples on the paper.Cons:*The speed of shredding paper is a bit slower than what I excepted*There is a hole in between the paper tray and the shredder for you to see the volume of how much of paper you have shredded. However, there are some dust come out from the hole while you shredding the paper.

  This is a great buy for the price.  I could have bought the 12-sheet model but for my home office this one is perfect and the price was good.  I've used it for about 3 months now (not every day but occasionally for an hour at a time).  It does a good job with 4 sheets, haven't tried 6 at a time.  A couple of times have shredded those plastic fake credit cards you get in the mail with new offers you didn't ask to receive.  They go through but slow it down some.  I've never had any problems with it choking up or clogging and I find it easy to empty.  Also if you put the mechanism back on the waste basket and accidentally get the cord under the top, it won't work until you remove the cord, which I didn't know when I bought it.  Good safety precaution, which I much appreciate.  I would definitely recommend this model and reorder it if I needed a replacement.  Don't think I'll need one for a while, though!

  So far, I haven't used this shredder much, but it seems to meet my needs well. Two comments:1. This shredder cuts pieces approx. 3/16"" x 1-3/4"" long. If the document was printed ""landscape"", some of the text may be readable. I recommend cutting such documents (and all credit cards) in half first, then feeding into the shredder with all printing horizontal.2. The instructions recommend monthly oiling with ""vegetable, cooking oil, or shredder oil."" It would be nice if an empty squeeze bottle were included so you can conveniently use oil you already have in your kitchen.

  Very good shredder, it cuts the paper in very small pieces and even ignores a few staples I neglect to remove before shredding. It can also handle thicker paper and many sheets of paper at once, I haven't had problems with overheating, it may be due me not being too fast to feed the shredder. It is easy to use and clean. It is pretty noisy, so you shouldn't use late at night or when you may bother others nearby.

  I read some reviews on this very issue of many times acting like the waste can is full when it's not. I hardly use it but when I do, it always hesitates while shredding saying it's needs to be emptied. If this wasn't an issue it would get 5 stars.. but who wants to wait everytime  they try and shred something? Not happy,, won't buy this brand again.

  This shreds  very well but emptying the basket is not easy.  I thought the basket would slide from under the shredder.  Instead the heavy shredder has to be lifted from the basket and placed on the floor.  Once the basket is emptied the shredder has to be lifted again and placed  back on the basket. It can be difficult to line up when replacing on the basket.

  I was surprised to be able to use it 20 minutes straight with no overheating problems. It ate up my thin corrugated pizza boxes with ease. Does the job with heavier corrugated, but struggles a bit. Recommend giving it cooling periods when shredding thick cardboard or corrugated like the box it arrives in.It's rated for 8 sheets and although I never counted, it's safe to say it can handle 8.I wouldn't do large amounts of 8 sheets at a time or heavier cardboard in one sitting. You can hear the motor bog down with thicker inputs, which means it's drawing more amperage, which causes heat. Heat will shorten the life of the motor. Runs great for 5-6 sheets at a time and the occasional 7 or 8.

  I was initially skeptical of this item after I realized it did not have a slide out compartment. You must lift the fairly heavy lid to empty the trash. After using the shredder I decided that was not a huge issue. I was able to shred thick documents with no jams or over heating. I think this is a solid shredder for the home office.

  I like that it’s pretty compact and convenient for home use. However it is NOT durable.The first one died on us after we put exactly 6-7 pages through.We gave it another chance and brought it again. Treated it with better care this time and it still died after 2-3 months of use.I guess this means we need a stronger office shredder for our needs.I guess if you live alone and only have 2-3 pages of mails to shred each time. It’s good for you. I and my bf comebine our mails and do a shredding run every few weekends with around 50 pages each session. This shredder is probz to lightweight for that purpose.

  Product was delivered today and looked okay. I took the plastic off and tape from around the paper basket. I opened the basket to see how easy/how much force to remove (just checking it out) and noticed paper shreds in the bottom. I thought maybe it was from the factory, like a test sheet before packing (giving the benefit of the doubt). Then I plugged it in and went to turn it on, switch clicked over and just slid back and forth not clicking into any setting. Nor did the shredder turn on. Seemed like this product was used or refurbished poorly. I paid for a brand new item and am pretty upset with the product they sent.I don’t think it was unpacked for 10 minutes before putting the return order through. Super disappointed.They are sending a new one in a few days. Will update my review then.

  What do you want from a paper shredder?  If you said anything like ""I want it to reliably shred several pages at once,"" then you have a very different view of paper shredders than Amazon Basics.  The shredder states, right on the item itself, that it can shred 6 pages of 20lb. bond paper.  Absolute nonsense.  It FREQUENTLY jammed shredding 3 pages of the cheapest, flimsiest paper you can buy (other than onion skin).  It occasionally jammed shredding 2 pages.  It will shred maybe...50-60 pages before it goes into ""overheat"" mode and becomes unusable for 30 minutes.If you plan to never need to shred paper, then this is the perfect paper shredder for you.  If, on the other hand, you might occasionally in your life have paper that needs shredded, you need to find something else.

  Have had this shredder for about a month now and I love it.  Our other shredder could only shred 2-3 pages at a time and would get jammed periodically.Just had to shred a huge stack of pages yesterday and loved being able to put several pages through at once.  Did not quit on me until it stopped to tell me the bin was full.  Love the large bin size.  Can't speak to longevity or durability over the long haul but I'm really happy with my purchase so far.

  I wanted a 12 sheet shredder on wheels as my previous on had.  It fatally faiiled suddenly a day or so ago.  To replace it with a 12 sheet unit would have made me wait 1 to 2 months.  I find shredders an  essential piece of equipment in a modern home office.  The new 8-sheet machine was delivered on time the next day after order and seems OK, but it is tiny compared to previous model and the process for emptying it is cumbersome.  One of those things:  a product so popular your company cannot keep up with demand. I will use it but will miss my bigger, wheeled, and easy to empty model that failed after years of service.

  Excellent item.  I've used paper shredders before but had issues with them.  This one does the job it's intended for while also shredding at least six papers at a time, and perhaps more.  Also no need to remove staples as it handles those easily and saves considerable time.  The price is too good to pass up if you're in need of one.  Simple, efficient and the basket holds a good amount of shredded paper so no need to empty it that often and if has a window into the basket so one can tell when it's due to be emptied.Highly recommended for home use.

  Very happy with this Amazon branded shredder. Not overly noisy! Experienced no jams so far (only had for about a week though) and shredded hundreds of sheets with it.I feel that 5 or 6 pieces of paper is the max it can handle comfortably (medium thickness). I haven’t used the card shredding option yet. I picked this model based on it’s price and the fact that it had a window in it to see if it was getting full. I purchased this for occasional home use not for a busy office.

  This product never worked as advertised (balked at 5 sheets of paper) and failed pretty quickly. The sensor failed, reverse failed, and since I don't shred much, was never even light duty. It was successful for me as only a manual on-off (turn off by hand after shredding)  that worked for 2-3 sheets at a time.Don't every buy any Amazon Basics -- I have purchased a few and everything is a failure.

  I bought this for a home office, where I don't shred a lot of things.  It replaced a similar low end shredder that finally gave up the ghost when I cleaned out a file cabinet and had my 7 year old shred a lot of things.  This shredder is a little less robust than the old one.  I notice that it struggles with junk mail and I have to open the envelopes of credit card checks before shredding.  My old low end shredder was only good for 6 sheets at a time if they were full sheets, but didn't have trouble with more layers when they weren't full widths, like a normal envelope with a 3 page trifold insert that is 11 layers, but only 4"" wide instead of 8.5.  This one really doesn't like anything thick, even if is small.In hindsight, I would take a step up from this model.

  My previous shredder would overheat quickly, causing me to have to wait after every few pages. This one has worked nicely so far, allowing me to shred significantly longer than my old shredder.

  I have a home office and decided over the holidays to shred documents I no longer needed when my Belkin shredder died.  The internal plastic surrounding the shredder jaws were all broken by wear.  I decided on the Amazon Basics shredder and love that it can shred 15 pages and also love that the shredder jaws keep turning even when paper isn't there so it gets all the pieces out.  The Belkin stopped once the piece was shredded and left pieces of paper in the jaws.  It is really sturdy, well built and has a fairly large bin so I can shred more before having to empty it.  I have a ton more things to shred (spring cleaning) so am excited to use this vs. the Belkin.

  I have over ten years worth of bank statements, insurance statements, etc., etc. and feel safer shredding them. What is wonderful about this shredder is not only the price but that you can put the standard 8 1/2 inch width paper width-wise into the shredder so everything gets shredded cutting from top to bottom going through all my vital information. The smaller width shredders I previously owned (all burned out) were not wide so the paper had to be inserted so it shred from left to right, the same direction as if you held that page and were reading it. It occurred to me that if someone was diligent there would be shredded pieces that still showed my full account numbers and personal info. I tested this and sure enough there was my info which just happened to be the part that the shredder teeth didn't cut through on the sheet.  It was time for a new shredder. The cross-cut on this Amazon Basic shredder is much better. Someone would really have to want your info badly to try piecing together this shredded paper. Only have it a few days but so far it is excellent.

  We use personal shredders in our home office, so have only a small amount of paper to shred at a given time and I didn't want to spend an arm and a  leg on a machine. This shredder has met our expectations!While I have not yet put 6 sheets through at a time, I have worked to minimize the pile of papers we accumulated while I researched and purchased  the new shredder. It has had no difficulty shredding enough paper to fill the bin each time - quickly and not too noisily. Not wanting to overheat the motor, after filling one bin, I've taken a break and returned to the task later, and it keeps right on going.I have not yet tried to shred credit cards or staples, however I have no worries about it's handling of an occasional one or the other.We are looking forward to continued use of this shredder and know that in the future, when another shredder is needed, we will look at purchasing the same one again.

  In this day and age you need one of these to shred medical papers, credit cards and other vital papers that have any of your important data on them.  This is great for home and small office.  I tested a months worth of papers and one credit card and it shreds it very well.  Much better than just strips. Its the perfect size for what I needed and can sit next to my desk out of the way but always ready to go.

  Cuts well. Product is doing what it was bought for, works well and gives me no cause to complain. I love the ""handle"" in the middle of the head for use when removing the product from the bin- makes the heavy weight of the top easy to handle. The clear view in the middle of the waste bin allows you to know in advance as it gets full.  Price was decent. The only ""complaint"" I would have is that the electrical connector in back stands out approx 2 inches from the wall.  While I don't like that particular fact -it alone has nothing to do with product function or reliability, only slight aesthetic problem that can be ignored.  I have been using the product for approximately two months.  Would repurchase this as I would almost any Amazon electrical article that I have purchased in the past (mainly cables and wires).

  I use this for home office. It is very sturdy and has been working well thus far. It only takes 12 pages so don't try to jam it because it gets hard to unjam once the paper gets packed in there, despite it trying to reverse the spin.

  I love my shredder. I was surprised how cheap the AmazonBasics shredder was and was weary it wouldn't be able to handle the task, but its been a few months now and its still going strong. Nothing more satisfying than watching credit card applications in the mail get sucked into the void.Overall its lightweight, not obnoxiously loud, and cleanup is as simple as picking up the top portion that just rests on a garbage bin, and then dumping the bin out. Two seconds. No need to undo any clips or anything fancy. Simple, just the way I like it.

  Needed an inexpensive shredder when setting up a new home office. This was the Amazon Choice and fit my parameters.6 or 7 trash bags of old documents later, it is still chewing through paper, no problems. Does well with credit cards and the like.I do question the 8 sheet rating on average or premium paper, maybe tissue. This is not a deal breaker. 2 or 3 sheets at a time and you can fill the bin without overheating.Would buy again and would recommend to a friend.

  This shredder worked once then quit No jam won’t move forward or backward, I repeat no jam whatsoever, bad motor? I only used 3 sheets of 20lb paper, motor makes whirring noice. Doesn’t turn, bad motor?

  This is an awesome shredder. I like that you can leave it on all the time and it only runs when you insert paper. You can stick a few sheets of paper in at a time and it will shred nicely. Too many sheets and it jams. It’s pretty small and fits nicely in the corner of our office. Works well for shredding mail or random documents. If you are looking to shred massive amounts of paper you may want to consider something larger or you will constantly be emptying out the waste basket. We use it casually here and there so we don’t have to empty out the basket much.

  Specification says 40 min run time, I assume that’s with 24 sheets. In reality most bills are 3-4 sheets and I ran this continuously doing 1 bill at a time over 5hrs and at least 5 bankers boxes of stuff. Great shredder and it’s quiet 👍

  This shredder was smaller than I expected it to be so I have to empty it more often, but it works great and does the job. It's probably better that it's smaller because I can move it easier, it's not so heavy for me to lift. So far I haven't had any complaints about it. I can't run it while I'm watching TV because it's pretty noisy.

  Works great.  I don't run 15 pages at a time through it.  I have and it did it, but it did seem a little labored.  But I put 8-10 sheets at a time through it regularly with no complaints about its performance.  Emptying the shredder without getting a few bits of paper on the floor is akin to eating crackers in bed and not getting a few crumbs in the sheets.  It just is what it is.  When I opened the box and first too the bin out of the shredder there were a couple of bits of paper In it. However there is a card in the paperwork that says it was tested before packaging.  I did spend a few bucks for the protection plan.  I work from home and generate a lot of paperwork.  Thought it might not be a bad idea  in case it stops working sometime in the next 3 years.

  Drawer is a little flimsy and with even 2 sheets it sounds a little strained but I shredded for 30 minutes - and was able to listen to the TV. I used to buy the $40 shredders but they never lasted and constantly jammed so I decided to move up in price with hopes this one will last and that the 'no jam' feature works. So far so good.

  Why have I not had a shredder before...This is the ideal solution for any home office and a must have! If you have a small business or any type of home office this little guy will definitely get the job done. The compact size is great and fits in any small space. Don't let the small size fool you because it has great shredding power. Knowing the importance of shredding documents and the high risk of identity theft, this was a great addition to our home. I priced several other shredders and did not see the need to pay hundreds of dollars for a similar shredder. The price of this shredder is fantastic and will get any job done. I especially like the credit card option and have not had any issues thus far. Its very important to oil your shredder and I recommend the oil sheets its the easiest and most convenient. The see thru window is nice because you can see when the bin is full. All in all this is a must have if you want to protect yourself from identity theft at the least expensive cost possible.

  For the money I don't think there's a better 6 sheet shredder. My last shredder from a box store lasted about three months and didn't have near the torque that this does. I haven't had any problems being about to shred most junk mail as well as credit cards. I can shred almost a whole bin worth of paper before it needs to cool down which is impressive. I've owned this for about 6 months now and am overall happy with the purchase. The only reason for a 4 star is if the shredder jams, it can be a pain to unclear so it would be nice to have a feature built in to possibly open the jaws or something but for the money you definitely can't complain.

  I ordered this shredder, despite the negative reviews. I thought since I’ve ordered other amazon basics products and had no issues, that I’d roll the dice with this one. I had the shredder two months (only used it twice) before it stopped working. You can’t just return this item if it breaks either. You have to call an outsourced “specialist” to walk you through troubleshooting. After 20 minutes, she put me on hold for 5-10 minutes to see who the manufacturer of the product was. I’m disappointed in myself that I didn’t trust the previous negatives reviews, but I am glad this broke while I am still within the return window.

  It's fast but loud, it hasn't jammed on me yet. You can put thick papers or a little stack in it & it will shred it all. Very easy to empty & small enough to hide under a home office desk or work office. I use this for personal use at home to protect against identity theft. Highly recommend this shredder.

  This shredder jams very easily and consequently, whether shredding two or more pages, you are pulling shreds out. Nothing in the ""unjamming"" directions helps; you have to carefully use your fingers to clear the jams. And it doesn't crosscut well, nor does it really shred six sheets; three maximum, and even that jams. It will shred a credit card, but labors to do so. I would never purchase this item again.

  Does a surprisingly good job for its size. Though, tthe way it shreds the paper doesn't always render it completely unreadable -- when I took a look at the shredded scraps the first time I used it, I noticed I could make out a line or two from the shredded document. Another negative is how easily it overheats. It's smartly programmed to shut down for cooling when overheated, a function I appreciate. But, because it so easily overheats and to begin with can only handle 6 sheets at once, you can only really get so much shredding accomplished at one time.

  So far far it shreds every thing I throw at it and suites my needs even though the other reviews regarding that you still can read the shreds are true but, and this is just my opinion mind you, I highly doubt a criminal is going to spend the time to puzzle you documents back together when they could just move on to an easier victims who don't shred, unless your in a rich neighborhood or something, which I am not :). What I do is just to fold the papers in half and feed side wides, this makes the shreds harder to read. As far as I'm concern this fine for home and definitely not recommended for business.

  After one bucketful of shredding, the thing just stopped! Grrr! Light won’t come in, won’t go forward or reverse.Edit: So apparently after a bit of use (maybe 10 minutes, stopping between each pass/shred so it’s not continuous), the machine will suddenly stop & you have to wait 30 minutes. This won’t be a problem if you don’t have a lot to shred at once, just don't clean out your files and expect to shred everything at once.

  I formerly had a shredder that cut 1/4"" wide strips. I like this one much better, it shreds much smaller and also crosscuts. Once you shred with this one you can't identify anything, much more security! Buyers should note that this shredder CANNOT handle shredding thicker credit cards. It does an ok job with thin, flimsy cards.

  This is a great shredder and so worth the price. Taking it out of the box and putting it together was a breeze and i tried it right away i put an envelope that i got in the mail for a credit card and it was pretty big and it shredded just fine no problems! It is not super bulky and it works just fine. The reverse button worlds as well, BUT it is a little loud so if you are in your home office at night and you don’t want to wake anybody you might want to wait to shred in the morning ! I will update in a couple months for durability of the product.

I will definitely consider this brand next time in fact it is my new go to for now.

  Right now it’s locked up with a paper jam I can’t get it to release. I hope I can get it to and the motor is not burned out. Actually not as reliable as my old one, which, when this one stopped, I sharpened and oiled up with sheets for that purpose that I bought from Amazon. If I can’t get this new shredder working again I guess I’m out of luck. Not convenient to ship it back.

  I haven't had any issues with this shredder. It's great! I try not to push my shredders too hard, though, so I only do about four sheets at a time. Haven't tried cards or CDs with it yet. Will update this review when I do.I did not buy the one that came with the oiling sheets. I have canola oil cooking spray, and I've read that this is just as effective if your shredder needs to be oiled. Cheaper than the sheets and just as effective, it seems! I'll oil it about once every three or so months. I don't use it a whole lot.

  For the casual user who just likes to shred documents with sensitive information, this shredder works fine. I've been able to destroy plastic chipped credit cards without problem as well. It doesn't handle many pages over 8 well and struggles with some staples. the noise level is not awful but is loud.There was also no clear indicator that metal cards could not be shredded so I gave it a shot. It took 10 minutes for me to unjam the shredder and the card managed to be ejected behind the plastic handle, which broke off part of the flimsy sensor and almost snapped a few wires connecting the power button. I had to take it apart to put the sensor back in place.Overall though, good value for the money.

  Started making some thudding noise after shredding a few single sheets. I know it is cheap junk make in China. So I will use it for as long as it lasts. The previous one I bought lasted only a few months during which I only used a few times. See my other review. Why don't I buy more expensive ones? I guess they are just bigger junk made in China with same abysmal quality. They cost more mainly because they are bigger and can run a couple of minutes longer at a stretch. The reviews speak for themselves.

  This shredder is great for a family who occasionally shreds mail.  The 6 page maximum holds true.  You aren't going to be able to jam this shredder with lots of paper at once.

There is a slot in front of the shredder where i can put the things like envelopes directly in the bin without unnecessarily shredding them.

  Burned it up the first time I used it.Limited the shredding to a max of 4 pages— and it started out great.

  It’s good but not great. A little loud and way slow in shredding papers (shred 5-8 papers at a time). The good part is it lasted for hours but I did put a small fan where the machine gets hot so it cools it down while using it.

  Updated: 12-18.  Auto-shut-off stopped working.  Tried pulling all the tiny bits of paper out of it.  Oiling it.  Nothing brought back the auto-shut-off.  Shredder still works but now I have to turn it on/on manually.Purchased: 9-16. I like that the trash container it comes with is the perfect size for a plastic grocery bag to be used as it's liner.  It fits perfectly next to my home desk where I can feed small amounts of statements or other paperwork that require shredding.  It has an auto on/off function so I can just reach over and feed a few sheets through when needed rather than having to first turn it on/off.  It does shred credit cards.  It definitely does not shred CDs or DVDs.  Good small shredder for the home office.

  I was able to shred an entire lawn and leaf bag of papers in an hour.  (Only because my last shredder was many years old and burnt out - I was backed up on paperwork after having cleaned out the filing cabinet). 8 sheets at a time effortlessly.  It has a large capacity bin and it's a quick clean up.  Credit cards go through one at the time and it cross shreds effectively.  I shred once a week at about 100 sheets per use. It's ideal for light home use.  Be sure to unplug as you would any electrical appliances.  The unit does get warm and please never try to fix a paper jam with it plugged in.  Be sure to not let the bin become compacted as it will cause a jam in the blades.  Proper maintenance is key and this is low maintenance enough that it is not cumbersome.

  I've had two of these. The first was ordered Dec. 13, 2016; it broke 3 months later. Even though the instructions say you can put 6 pieces of paper in it, I only put 4 at a time. I never used it for a credit card. When it broke, I bought another one in March 2017. The ""shreds"" are just under 2 inches long. It is not a cross-shredder, at least not like any one I've had before. This one has trouble shredding more than 3 sheets of cheap paper at a time. For the money I've spent on two of these, I could have bought the Fellws model at Wal-Mart that lasted fifteen years.

  This shredder is great. It cross cuts, which means it doesn’t just shred straight down, which means I really don’t have to worry about someone trying to put my shredded mail back together. Since my identity was stolen, the cross shred is important to me, and it can shred a good amount of paper at once, and credit cards. I wouldn’t do more than 4 papers at a time, just to be safe. It’s small enough to put under a table I have, so it’s not in plain sight, and it has a little window that shows you where the papers are up to, which is nice as well.

  We have made AmazonBasics purchases before (almost all great products), but this item did not meet our expectations. The main reason for the 3 star rating is due to shredded paper gathering  underneath on one corner. This causes a dense bunch of shredded paper to pile up and after 35-45 pages, slows down the shredder significantly. We have not disassembled the unit in any way, but have to use needle-nose pliers to extract the built-up shreds. It does shred up to 6 pages at a time, so it functions, but this bunching does make it inconvenient for copious shredding.

  Great for the price. Did not rate safety features as I wasn't even aware it had any. Did not rate noise because it's a paper shredder so of course it's loud.Wish I would have went with something a little nicer. Only because I didn't realize I'd be shredding so many things over the 6 sheet limit.Bills go through fine but credit card companies, probably on purpose, send offers that are like 3-4 sheets (folded over for 6-8), one of which is usually like card stock or something, plus a faux card. This will not handle that. You have to open them and break it up into something more manageable.

  I bought this shredder to handle all of my old documents, tax information, pay stubs and statements. It has a 6-sheet capacity, so putting in more paper than that at once is asking for trouble. It can handle credit cards and plastic as well, just be careful not to put too much in at one time or it may jam. It will take care of staples for you, so you don't need to sit there and waste time popping staples before shredding. I like the way it cross-cuts the paper, it makes the shreds small and near impossible to reassemble (If you happen to shred the wrong thing, you're out of luck).Excellent shredder, no complaints here. 5/5 Stars

  Since day one this thing jammed, even with shredding only a couple papers.  After two months there was a significant jam that had to be manually removed.  Once the jam was corrected, the shredder made a constant noise when turned on and even when not in use.  It jammed again a second time, and when I tried to remove the jam, I noticed several of the ""teeth"" were bent.  At this point, I can't use this shredder anymore and it's only a few months old.

  The is by far the best shredder we have ever used or purchased. Our little Aurora AU895XA lasted for years before the tiny plastic drive gear wore out. The Amazon is quieter, handles more sheets of paper, you don't have to worry about a missed staple, and a lot more room before emptying the shredded paper. Shredding old taxes this year should be fun, not a chore!

  I loved the price and thought it would be fine for my home office since I don't really do much shredding.  Bought last October, jammed in February.  I cleared the jam by reversing and then getting it to run on the automatic feed but it would not accept the paper to shred.  I guess I got what I paid for.  I'll buy a higher quality one at a higher price and throw this out.  I had a similar problem (broke after a short period) with an Amazon basic toaster in that it worked at first and then the middle heat coils stopped working.

  This product is just what it said to be: a basic shredder. My shredding needs amount to receipts, mailing labels and so forth. I use it a few times per month in low volumes. 8 sheets of 20 lb paper is pretty accurate, as long as you realize 20 lb paper is pretty lightweight. Also, it is ironic that a lot of small Amazon packages come in the plastic-with-bubbles-on-the-inside mailing envelopes... and shredding those is hit-and-miss with the label most often getting caught in the blades or even slightly melted if the unit is hot. I try to avoid those. I would buy this again as long as this one holds up for a year or more.

  This is a nice shredder. I'm really glad I got this particular model. You can run out to an ""office supply store"" and find dozens of these on the shelves, but I've used plenty of those (used to work at an office supply store in fact) and this one is a heck of a lot quieter and so far I haven't been able to bog it down.By far the best thing about this shredder is that if you don't feed a document in perfectly straight, the sides, however they designed them, don't seem to have any issues with it and you can watch the paper fold over on itself perfectly without hearing any straining from the motor.The size of the cuts is fairly average - don't know why other reviewers were complaining that it was too large. I have no problem with the ""final product"".Remember to keep this and any shredder you own lubricated. Use ordinary canola oil - look up the MSDS for the ""shredder lube"" you can buy on Amazon and in stores if you don't believe me - most of it is just 99+% canola oil.

  I dont know how much the machine has been used, so now I have to buy lubricants papers and if it were brand new I could have at least waited 2 weeks to a month.Also, the machine makes a loud sound after inserting a paper, not sure if that is normal and I hope that is not a reason for the previous owner returning the item.

  I like that it shredded the paper which is the reason I bought it.  I don't like how it is so loud, It only shreds 1 piece of paper at a time, it only runs continuously for 2 to 3 minutes and it started to die after 2 years with moderate use and completely died after 3 years.  I feel I got my monies worth out of it though. I would recommend it for light use.

  WOW!  I worked in an accounting office for 35 plus years.  With 20 of that in public accounting and this is a great shredder.  My wife’s first comment was that is much quieter than the old one. I was cleaning out many files and had this shredder running constantly for over an hour and never overheated.  It chews through cd’s with ease.I highly recommend this for home or a small to medium office setting.

  I thought I was going to get a product that works. I originally bought a shredder from a different company and  it broke because paper was stuck.  I decided to go with Amazon because I needed to get rid of the rest of the paper, not much. I used it for one day. I put paper in and it worked fine then because I tried not to go over 8 pages. Now the motor works but it doesn't shred. I have to purchase another shredder because this one doesn't work less than one month. I didn't purchase insurance because I thought I didn't need it.. big mistake. I got rid of the boxes and I don't even know if there's a warranty.

  I'm becoming a fan of Amazon Basics --- the only drawback of this shredder is the dust. I realize they all produce some dust, just wish it could be contained. I did a major shredding in my office and the dust debris on everything near me was pretty crazy. It is something I will tolerate, tho, as it was a pretty heavy shredding event and I shouldn't base it solely on that instance. Doesn't quite take 25 sheets at a time, I wouldn't go over 10. I would recommend this product.

  Great for home use. Took me about 15 mins and 50 items non-stop before the cool down kicked in and then took about 5-10 min before it would let me continue.

  I needed to get a home shredder but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one is nothing fancy, but it does the job. Have not had any jam-ups yet. I recommend inserting less than the maximum number of sheets and monitoring the basket to make sure it is not getting too full. I'm hoping to avoid having any problems with this one for a long time.

  This is a great shredder.If you have a lot of shredding to do you will need to break it up into several days or so.While shredding the Paper shredder would only do 2 loads before auto-shutting off for 30 mins.The loads are small but at the same time it is great that the shredder isn't enormous.It did a great job shredding multiple papers at once and credit cards.This shredder would be best used for shredding small stacks of paper occasionally not a large quantity as it overheats and will shut off until it cools down.

  Was looking for a small, in-home shredder.  This fits the bill & more.  Quiet — much quieter than my old one — and shreds into tiny cross cut pieces.  I normally shred about 4-5 pages at one time but it did do up to 8 as advertised.  Slowly, but did it.  I thought I had burned it out after 1 pailful, as it didn’t start back up.  Turns out I had put the top back on wrong.  So we know the safety mechanism works!Yes, I would recommend to others if you have a small amount to shred weekly.

  The shredder does a decent job of shredding paper and credit cards, but it seems to struggle with more than three sheets of printer paper at a time.  It works best with just 1-2 sheets at a time.  After about 10 minutes of continuous use, the shredder will likely overheat.  When this happens, you have wait a half hour for it to cool down before starting it up again.It's fine for daily use, 10-20 sheets at one go, but if you have a lot to shred it's probably best to spend your money elsewhere.

  This may sound silly, but a paper shredder is fun to use. I had wanted one for years, but I never thought of it as necessary, so I waited. Having recently moved into a city and especially since the way recycling is collected here combined to make me feel it was time to safeguard our privacy better. I chose this one based on ratings and features.Day 1. It does everything I need it to do. It shreds paper and credit cards and gives me a juvenile sense of satisfaction. I bought the extended warranty. I'll let you know if I have to use it.

  Got it yesterday and used it as soon as it arrived.  We shred a lot.... Anyway.  It worked as described right out of the box.  I shredded CDs, credit cards and paper.  Everything was perfect.  The size it great and I love how easy it is to take out the shredded material and put it in the trash.  No mess at all.

  I liked this for casual use and it was working fine. However, when we decided to shred all our old document we had kept in files for years, it only lasted a couple of hours. The red light came on for over heating so we stopped to let it cool down over night. Now it doesn't work at all....it's just DEAD! We were not even putting 8 sheets or full sheets of paper into it, just some thin checks and smaller sales receipts, etc.

  Its a nice and decent shredder. Does its job well enough for the very nice price of the unit.It will slow down on lots of stuff jambed in the slot. But thats to be expected. It runs a bit loud, but thats to be expected too. Has a small bucket that fills up pretty quick, but thats avoidable by just dumping it once in awhile lol. It doesnt turn stuff into tiny bits of confetti, but its not supposed too. Basically anything that could be a 'con' for this unit, doesnt really apply, because this unit was built with a specific purpose in mind, and its what I use it for.Does a good job, and it will do so till it eventually dies like all appliances do these days ;) Thankfully it didn't break the bank for how long it will last! Thanks amazon for selling affordable stuff!

  This is a great little shredder! We shred all our junk mail and compost it, so some days this thing gets put to work! It's a small bin so it needs to be emptied every 2 or 3 days but does exactly what we wanted it to. Easily shreds a few sheets of paper at once; can shred up to about 8 sheets of paper at one time but it doesn't sound too happy about doing so.

  Same issue as a lot of other buyers. After about 2 years, whatever sensor or button that detects when a piece of paper has completed moving through and shuts the motor off, must be broken because the auto feature no longer works. Switching to auto allows the motor to run forever even with nothing in the slot to shred. I tried cleaning in the slot, etc but it made no difference.

  This ""AmazonBasic"" shredder works beautifully. Best of all it is small, thus stores very well in my limited-space office closet. I've used it extensively and had no issues with it at all. It is inexpensive enough that if I do or when it reaches its end-of-life, it won't break the bank to replace it. Much better for my purposes than other more expensive ones I've bought in the past.

  I've had this shredder for quite some time now. I bought one recently for my girlfriend and my mom. All 3 of us have had zero issues with it! The only complaint I have is I wish the shredded pieces were a tiny bit smaller, but all in all, I can't complain....it's light years better than the ones that shred into strips! All 3 of us have never oiled the blades or anything. Opens it up, set it up, plugged in and start shredding. So far, it's handled everything I've thrown at it....credit cards, paper with staples, complete, unopened envelopes that were filled with junk mail etc. It does bog down, but as long as you don't go nuts with it, it will get the job done. All in all, you really can't beat the quality for the $$. Oh, one last thing, the only other slight complaint I have is I wish it had an ON setting. It has auto, off and reverse. Constant on would be a bonus for when you hav a years worth of things to shred.

  I've wanted a a shredder for a long time, and when I finally had the money for one, I saw the good rating for this one and said why not. I did see one review where the person said there's looked like it was used I thought it can't be, but then I got mine and saw paper in the bin and I was like meh whatever its used but as long as it gets the job done im happy. It did not get the job done. Oh boy was I surprised to find out my shredder fresh out the box was jammed. I understand we're going through as pandemic everyone is not exactly on their A game, but before the world was ending y'all were screwing up my orders. All I ask is to just let me shred my papers with no issues during what could be my potential last days please and thank you.

  I thought that by paying $64 I would be getting a great shredder, no.  The first time I used it, it got jammed.  No, I didn't put more than 12 sheets of paper through it.  It jammed on an envelope.

  This shredder is a nice size for a home office. Compact and fits easily tucked beside my desk. I primarily got it because it also shreds credit cards, which it did very quickly with no problems. It says it can shred up to 6 sheets. I've not tested that, as usually what I have to shred is only a page or two. If you're shredding more than typical household mail, then you may want to consider a larger unit.You can either set it to auto, where it will start shredding when you put a sheet of paper in, or off. It also has a reverse feature if for some reason, what you've put in is clogging. It sits on its own waste basket, which you can put a bag in for easy disposal. The only thing that I would've have liked is a small window on the basket so you can see how full it is. But other than that, I have no complaints. It works great.

  Bought this so I could finally get around to shredding a bunch of shenanigans (whole bags worth of stuff). I was able to get everything shredded in 2 days! It only overheated once and was cool with 30 minutes of recommended rest (based off the manual). I recommend this product for anyone whos looking to shred normal every day stuff/other sensitive papers, but with a little added security as it is a cross shredder. (I have trust issues).

  I really needed a shredder to get rid of some old documents and decided to go with this one. It gets the job done just fine and wasn't too expensive. Quiter than I thought it would be but still a bit noisy, don't expect to be able to do some late night shredding and not wake anyone up. It says it can handle 8 pages at once, but it starts to struggle at 3 or more. Overall works fine, would recommend it.

  I am a Special Ed. teacher and often have extra copies of confidential documents (draft copies or just making too many copies on the copier) that need to be shredded rather than just throwing them in the trash can. I had a shredder I inherited from my grandmother after her death that was heavy as lead and jammed easily. Well, it quit working, and I needed a new shredder. I chose this one because of the good ratings and the low price. I have only had it a short time, but so far it has worked great without any problems. It is only meant for small jobs, and for my purposes, it is exactly what I need. If you need to shred lots of paper all the time, I would recommend going with a heavy-duty shredder, but for occasional use, a few minutes at a time, this one is perfect.

  I received my shredder a few weeks ago and was so excited to begin using it. Quickly I realized that it just couldn’t handle six sheets of paper without jamming. At first I was putting in a few sheets at a time and it shredded perfectly, then I increased it to six pieces which the shredder states it can handle and that is when the problems began. When it jammed I put it in reverse and it was stuck. My husband had to unplug it and take it apart to unjam it and clean it out.Plugging it back in we crossed our fingers and turned it back on. Success! I began shredding the remaining papers that I had, but I had learned my lesson and will not put in more than four pieces at a time. Now my shredder works beautifully as long as I do not go above four papers at a time.This is a nice lightweight shredder and I would recommend it if you are going to shred every once in a while or if you only need to shred a few pieces of paper at a time. If you are going to do heavy duty shredding, I would invest in a more durable shredder.

  This is one tough shredder. Bought this to go through 20 plus years of personal and business records. Bought the larger sheet capacity because some friends have the smaller version of this machine and it won't really shred a typical bill all in one shot.This one did not disappoint.  Will quickly shred pretty much anything you put in it. Barely boggs down when shoving the advertised number of sheets into it. Chews up CDs and credit cards in seconds.You got corruption or embezzlement to cover up? This is the machine for you. Fast, and quiet you'll have that pesky evidence destroyed and be out the backdoor before they hear it and can break down the front.10 will get ya 20 would buy this again.

  This thing is great. It’s a little on the noisy side, but I have not had a problem with anything getting jammed. I’ve run envelopes with about 10 sheets folded and it has taken it like a champ! Cuts right through credit cards inside envelopes with no problem. I was skeptical because it was the cheapest paper shredder, but it has been PERFECT.

  Not a satisfactory product. Says it handles 8 pages but struggles with six. It doesn’t cut all the way through after five. It says it handles credit cards and although I haven’t tried that because I don’t have one to shred I can say that on a credit card offer that has one of the fake Cardboard cards in it, it struggles. It jams a lot. I mean A LOT. You constantly have to pull the top off and move the paper around so it doesn’t build up directly below shredder teeth and then clean out the shredder teeth. It overheats a lot as well. I’m not putting anything thick or extraordinary through this thing. Just mail credit solicitations and it struggles. I’m not returning it but I don’t recommend buying it.

  Well since I have missed the deadline to return this shredder, I will give a review. This Shredder only lasted one use. I had only shredded enough paper to fill the bucket once. I was very disappointed. I was looking forward to getting a lot of papers shredder. I was very careful to not put too many pages through. Not even the total maximum amount of 8 sheets. I was so disappointed with this shredder and now I have nothing and this one cost me enough.

  I've had this for a couple of years.  It was perfect for when I had the occasional bank statement or other bit of information I wanted to shred.  But when I started to use it more regularly, it's flaws exposed themselves.  It says it takes six sheets, but it does not do so reliably.  If you are shredding several things in a row, go slow.  The motor heats up.  The basket fills quickly, too, if you are using this for an active business.  If you have a pile of papers, it will take you a lot of time.

  I unboxed it, put the shredder on the bin, and immediately began to shred old mail. It did bog down a little if the envelope was a little thick, but it held up really well. (I quit putting the thicker ones through)All in all a very quick machine, nominal sound, and it did as advertised. I’m very happy with this machine.

  Great value for the money.  This little shredder does a really good job of shredding the documents that are put into it.  I had a nice backlog of documents to feed into this when I first got it, as my prior shredder unceremoniously perished a fair while ago, and I kept putting off the replacement for it.Don't be deterred by the low price, which rivals much inferior products at Warehouse stores; this shredder is the real deal.  When you open it, you may find that there are a few shreds left in it from the testing (as I did) and there is a rough patch on the inside of the front of it.  Both of these are intentional, and they demonstrate a few of the very thoughtful quality control processes that go into these little beasts.Admittedly, this can't handle massive amounts of paper, as it is just a mere home shredder; however, it does seem to serve the purpose of shredding old bills and bank cards quite well.  Also, compared to my previous shredder, it's almost eerily quiet.

  This is a hefty shredder but works very well.  It is medium sized and shreds number of pages as promised.  The top/shredder piece comes straight off so you can turn the bucket over into a bag or recycle bin for easy disposal making cleaning it out easy as opposed to some shredders that have the bucket slide out.  Little to no mess!  I bought this for myself and recently purchased again for my mother.  It is as noisy as any other shredder.  Highly recommend!

  This thing is a Paper shredding beast.I shredded 3 years of junk mail that over collected in one day. I overheated it roughly 3-5 times and it took it like a beast. It definitely has some sort of Overheat shut off. It will NOT shred until you let it cool down.Still works 100%If this thing can survive my punishment. ANYONE will be perfect. I literately shredded papers ALL day while watching movies. I'm not kidding.Yes I did make sure I oiled it after I was done too. Never neglect maintenance.

  Bought this shredder a year ago and it’s still going strong! It has a safety shield up top to avoid cutting fingers. Papers go in at a slight angle. Able to effectively shred four or five papers at a time. Can keep the machine plugged in with no noise, and it automatically goes on when papers are placed for shredding.  Motor is quieter than many other models, but some noise is necessary to get the job done. No problems with clogging. Useful!!
