  I give all products a 3 rating unless I’m exceptionally impressed with them. I purchased this for home n procrastinated to the point of having 3 bins to empty. So far the pros: while I’d never try to put 15 sheets in at once it did multiple thick envelopes with the staples as well. No problem with credit cards. Def very good tiny cross cuts. Also it can run for 45 min before having to cool down. Unlike others I looked at that were similar n only ran for 3-5 mins n need 45 min cool down. Im very pleased. As far as the cons go I’ve noticed most reviews say how these make it a day or two after their warranty n break. I bought an addl 5 yr warranty for like 7$ or something. So if it lasts on it’s own longer than warranty I’ll change score

  edit:  I ended up not returning cause it was so well price.  But it took me over an hour to deal with the jam and it def cannot take as many sheets at once as advertised.  As long as you just use a few sheets at a time it will be fine...Jammed up the first time i used it.  Tried that oil and it didn't work.  No other way to free up.  Sending back.  Got jammed above the cutting blades and there's no other way to free up.  I guess you can take the whole thing apart.  No thanks.  Not even close to the maximum capacity.  Returning and looking for a machine that can easily get unjammed...  Annoying.  Amazon basics not ready for prime time.....

  GOOD:  -- Notably quiet.  -- Paper shreds to a small size that is unlikely to be reassembled, especially after you mix the bag.  -- Opening seems too small for adult fingers (a plus for safety).  -- A shredder bag can easily fit over the canister.  -- Relatively fast.  -- Easy to operate.  --Doesn't seem to create and scatter visible dust like some micro-cut shredders do.  -- Seems to be well-made and should be durable.NOT-SO-GOOD:  -- Shredded paper seems to stick to the cogs at the exit, which makes it rather messy when emptying the bag unless you brush the paper hanging down from the cogs.  -- Gummed envelope material seems to stick to the cogs even more than regular paper.  This means shredding those dad-gum gummed address labels is probably not a good idea (we use scissors on those).  --The shredded paper is not compacted in the bin, so you'll have to push the paper down or empty the bin more often.  -- I know you're not supposed to do this, but access for repairing the machine is limited (we doubled the life of our previous shredder by disassembling and cleaning the rotors). -- The bin doesn't easily shut after being opened for emptying, and apparently Amazon does not sell replacement bins, so if yours jams while shutting it for goodness sake don't force it.SUMMARY:  It's a good value -- quiet, fairly inexpensive, small size of shredded paper without creating visible dust, capability for several sheets at once.

  I was planning on using this for shredding financial records, but quickly found out that if you feed standard, horizontal ""landscape"" reports into the shredder in a vertical ""portrait"" way, the pieces are so long that you can clearly read complete numbers, account descriptions and codes, names attached to specific accounts, etc.  Can't count on everyone using it the other way.  Just not acceptable for a ""cross-cut"" shredder.  Am now going to have to go through what was ""shredded"" and cut them up individually.

  Pretty thrilled with this shredder right now !  I was suspicious at first and considered sending it back because it had shreds in the bottom of the drawer already like someone had used it and sent it back. Instead, I opted to try it first.  I had a completely full 15 gallon garbage bag of financial documents  in the corner of my bedroom that I had been unable to shred with my old super slow shredder that would shut down after 2-3 minutes of use. So, I commenced shredding, and shred, and shred and shred, nonstop, until the entire bag was finished ! This shredder is definitely KING of shredders, IMO, for the price ! VERY happy !

  The strips into which the paper shreds are quite large -- large enough that you could actually read a whole twelve-point font on each shred.  It's adequate security for those of us who don't expect the FBI to analyze our trash content, but compared to the last cross-cut shredder I had at a similar tier (a Royal CX80 Cross Cut Shredder), this is disappointing.It really is a LIGHT DUTY machine.  It jams easily, and will stop without the overheat indicator lighting.  It might be unfair to remove a star because the machine, which pretty much advertises itself as light duty, proves that it actually is.  But I've had two other ostensibly light-duty shredders which were robust than this one.It otherwise is a decent shredder.  The design, where the mechanical unit just sits on top of the bucket, is good:  You can line the bucket with a plastic bag, and if the bucket fills and starts pushing the shredder up, you can still empty the unit without getting shredded paper all over the place, as might happen with a unit that uses a drawer or tilt-bin.  The unit is quiet.  The motor runs a full second or so after it finishes with the last page, so if you feed more paper in, the motor cycles less than if it were to shut instantly.  This also allows the paper to get all the way through the shredder even if it were fed at an angle.  I've shred some solid cardstock without problem, and it seems to be true to its eight-sheet capacity of normal weight paper, for the most part, with some qualification.  I do shred in volume -- more than is appropriate for these small machines -- so I might demand more than it's designed for.

  It stopped working out of the blue. Never used more than one page at a time. Took really good care of it. Tried different outlets, it's stopped working. Doesn't even reverse. Poor quality :(

  I bought this shredder last week after looking at the 4.7 star rating and the great price of $99.99. So far has performed as rated. Glad I didn't spend the $189 for the comparable Fellowes shredder. Good job Amazon. I give it 5 stars.

  I bought this as a replacement for my home shredder but it was no better than the one it replaced.  If you have serious shredding to do, then this is not a good model.  If you are using it every day, perhaps, it would be ok.  But if you're like me, and only shred from time to time, it simply is not powerful enough to handle mass shredding days.

  I want to preface this review by saying that I purchased the AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder with Pullout Basket, and that thing is absolutely wonderful. I am spoiled with that thing by comparison, but I needed a small shredder for a second location where I don't need to shred a bunch of documents. That led to this purchase.This is a smaller shredder with a smaller capacity waste bucket that the shredder mounts on top of. you can use a plastic bag inside to catch all the waste. It is a standard crosscut that cuts thin short strips, but not as fine as the micro-cut. It was able to cut 6 pages of 20lb paper without any problem, but it slows a little to do so- no big deal. It seems like it has good power and might be able to do more in a single pass, but I don't want to chance this- that is what the bigger shredder is for.My impression is that this small shredder will fit the intended purpose for light duty use- a couple of papers here and there. It is priced at a steal of a deal at $30, especially if you have amazon prime and the thing ships to you in 2 days or less- shipping along on a similar package would cost about $12 bucks by UPS Ground...not Second Day Air. If you have a bunch of shredding to do, consider the bigger shredder- AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder with Pullout Basket. That thing is like a paper grinder- works well and makes a neater generated paper waste that pours out of the can.

  I purchased this bad boy for my wife’s home office. Let me start off by saying this thing shreds harder than Andy Brinker from the 1998 classic film Brink. For those of you who don’t know, this 99 min film introduced some of the most unique roller blade shredding ever witnessed. Purchase this and you can be shredding like Andy in no time!Update** after using the the shredder my wife has been walking around the house being very confrontational. She now says things like “Bruh, do you even shred!?” For this reason I have to deduct one star.

  This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,

   PROS: I want to cover first the high-quality and well-built aspects of this paper shredder. I’ve seen other reviews I personally think the garbage can (bottom portion/ container) is well-built. It had zero problem shipping to me in one piece. I’ve tested and this can easily shred 15 to 16 pieces of normal copy paper and probably 12 of the thicker resume paper. Personally I use this to shred cardboard. (with all the boxes that I get from Amazon and/or for business it’s a great for shredding cardboard) and compost it afterwards. If you see in the video and photo attached the shredder has no problem going through very thick cardboard whatsoever.  Think “A hot knife through butter”. I also want to say that the machine is extremely quiet in comparison to other shredders a have owned or currently own. I’ve seen on other reviews people said it was loud. It obviously isn’t going to be silent. Even in comparison to the Amazon basics 8 sheet shredder, it’s about half as quiet as that. That link is below if you don’t need something this heavy-duty as the 12 sheet.Link to the AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper, CD and Credit Card Home Office Shredder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN9NX0I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BlQDDbTFVANXGCONS: My two issues with this shredder. One the bottom canister or garbage can cannot be replaced because of the safety mechanism that is built into the shredder. I realize it’s put there for safety but it’s kind of a pain if it ever cracks or breaks. Two is the opening only measures about 8.75-9 inches. If a larger amount of paper or cardboard is loaded in and isn't square to the opening it can jam. That’s easily resolved with the reverse button on the top of the shredder. I would link to see this same shredder with a 12 inch opening.Bottoms line is I would buy again or recommend to a friend.If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.

  I have gone through two of these now. The first one seemed decent and I blame myself for overworking it one day.  The second one, however, I barely used and was extremely careful in how many documents I put in at once.  This one died after a few months with no warning. It is plugged into a surge protector with other items that still work so it was not a power fluctuation. It was just dead one day with no power or sign of life at all. I am annoyed because it was clearly a defective unit but I am outside any return window.

  I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!

   This shredder works as advertised. In the attached video you can see it shredding a stack of 15 pages of paper, a CD, and a credit card. All seemed to work without incident. As you can see in the video it creates small cross shredded strips that will make reassembly of the original document more difficult. Stacks of documents will compress into thick strips that require some effort to separate.I would like to see paper bags or something to go in the wastebin as I would like to send the shredded material out to recycling without the having to dump it into another bag later.Currently the device has a bit of an oily / burnt smell but I have a feeling that it's lubricant from the factory. I expect that to dissipate and will report back if it does not. I will also report back on any long term issues I have with it.

  Over the years I've used a full-size shredder, a micro-shredder, and now this guy. So far, this is the best one.For starters, if you want a continuous-usage shredder you're not going to find it here. If you need to shred for hours and hours spent the cash for a commercial-strength full-size shredder. If, on the other hand, you're occasionally shredding a contract or credit card statement, this will do the trick nicely.I put this shredder through it's paces immediately upon receiving it, because I bought it to shred a large stack of papers I needed to shred to free up some space (tax returns, credit card statements, etc). The device is POWERFUL for it's size. It's blades are small but mighty. Seriously, you can hear this thing rev up like a little jet engine ready to gobble paper up. You CAN overload it with continuous 6-sheet shreds (it's a bad idea to shred a lot of multi-paper jobs at the max thickness a shredder is rated for), but if you let it breath a little between jobs and only feed it a few pages at a time, it handles it nicely.I expected the device to jam after shredding this huge stack of papers and it did, but I was able to clear it without too much trouble (I wish the opening was a little wider so I could easily pull out stuck paper with needle-nose pliers, but that's the only flaw in the device I found). A few minutes of reverse, forward, reverse, and a few yanks with the pliers and the one jam cleared without further issue.The real nice thing is that this device seems to handle paperclips just fine, and has a nice size waste bin for a product in this low price range.Well, there you have it. I was expected a piece of junk in this price range for very small jobs, and was overjoyed to find this device a step up. It has plenty of power, and shreds beautifully. Just don't try to run it for an hour shredding construction paper, folders, and 6 pages at once. Feed it a few pages at a time or one thick piece at a time and let it cool down every few minutes, and it should last you a good long time. Or at least longer than my last mini-shredder did. That thing is toast.

  ​I purchased this shredder 3 months ago. Love it!I was looking for something basic for my home office.Pros: - Instead of cutting vertically (""strip-cutting""), this shredder chops the sheets both horizontally and vertically (""cross-cut""). Instead of having some long spaghettis of papers, you get some little pieces of spaghettis, much harder for somebody to infer the original content. - Automatic mode: the shredder starts automatically when you insert a sheet (you can disable this behavior). It will stop on its own if you don't insert anything else. - The security trigger locks the shredder as soon you remove the head from the bin. - It doesn't take much room. - Transparent window to see through to know when to empty the bin. - Not noisy.Cons: Nothing for now.Notes:Avoid plastic envelopes/papers. I tried to shred an envelope made of plastic. Pieces of plastic got stuck inside of the blades. It took me 20 minutes to get it clean. That's when the ""reverse"" feature comes handy.I would recommend this item if you need something basic for daily use. If you want something for multiple people, I would go for something bigger.​

  Got this a while ago for my husbands office and after only 5 uses, it has died. He only ever puts one paper at a time in it so it wasn't overworked. We are only in our 20's so it's not like we have a lot of stuff to shred besides important bills or the occasional paper with our personal info on them. I wish I would have just paid a little more for a better sredder because it's too late to return this. It's going in the garbage now. They don't build things like they used to smh

  This shredder was purchased to replace a Fellowes strip shredder that lasted for fifteen years.  I chose this cross cut Amazon Basics over the Amazon Basics micro cut.  Both Shredders were the same price.  This cross cut model may make less of a mess when emptying the collection basket.I did shred fifteen 20 pound pages as the shredder is rated without a problem, but I will go no higher than nine or ten pages just to play it safe in hopes the shredder will have a long life. I don’t see a security issue with this cross shredder for my needs.  I don’t picture an international spy ring digging thru my garbage.  See attached photo of a shred example.  I examined the shredded paper closely and could not find any readable information.  If you are concerned are about account numbers, SSNs, etc. just feed the paper where the printed text is parallel/horizontal to the feed slot whether it’s a micro or cross cut.  This shredder did a great job shredding a DVD with personal information on it.  The DVD is definitely completely destroyed.Do oil the cutting blades as recommended.  All shredders need maintenance.  Overall I would recommend this shredder.PROS• Secure shred• Safety features• Auto Feed• Continuous reverse and forward if needed• The basket has rollers on the rear that fit into tracks keeping the basket straight and lined up as required• Large window to check if the basket is getting full.  See attached photo• Shreds a DVD/CD• The noise level is no more or less that any other consumer/small office shredderCONS• The power cord is five feet in length.  A standard six footer would be nice.• The printed description of the status lights (power on, errors) and switch (ON/OFF, FWD, REC, AUTO) is very small for the average senior or person with similar vision capabilities

  Quiet machine with ample capacity both in number of sheet at a time and duty time.  The bin for chads is more than adequate for large shredding parties.  The machine is heavy (it should be) and very stable.  I would buy this again and again.  BTW it does a goos job of shredding old CD's, ( I had some old tax records on them.) But, who has CD's anymore? If you are wondering, the chads are small enough for security purposes.  Besides once you shred 10 sheets everything is so commingled no one is stealing your info.Update: I’ve shredded at least 10 bankers boxes of old taxes, military records, estate papers, etc.  I ate them all including numerous CD’s with files and a few credit cards.  The chads are small so no one will be able to read anything off of them.  I like the size of the bin, in daily household use you shouldn’t have to empty it but once a month.  I think the product would be great for 5 or 6 person office too.

  Last it lasted 6 years! And this one cost $4 less!A few pointers...1. Don't try to shove envelopes full of paper into this thing.- It's not a high-end device, but it will do the job.-Go ahead and open each envelope an feed the pages one or two at a time (seriously, you can take a few seconds to do this). :-) it will keep the motor alive slot longer.2. The weight of the motor and cutting blades makes it a little top heavy, so find a stable place to put it (like between a chair and a cabinet) to keep it from spilling over.3. Feed your shredder an 'oil sandwich' once a month: take two pieces of paper, zig-zag a pattern of some light cooking oil (not motor or olive oil, please) on one of the pages, then slap the other page on top of it; like pieces of bread around a jelly sandwich... then feed it to your shredder.- Putting the oil between sheets of paper contains the oil and limits the amount smeared on the mouth of the shredder.- This will lube the blades to make future shreds much easier.- Read the manual that accompanies the shredder for more info on oiling requirements.4. Recycle your shredded paper.  I recycle my old clear plastic dry cleaning bags to gather the shreds and put out with all the plastic stuff. Our local recycling plant staff asks us to put shredded paper in clear bags so they can see what is inside before they open it up.Happy shredding!!!

  I just got it earlier this week, but I had gathered bags and bags of old paperwork that needs to be shredded and there is no public drop-off point for me in these times.  I went for a 24 page shredder as a compromise between quality and price.  This unit more than meets my needs and although in one sitting I will not be able to shred everything, this will work just fine if you have lots to shred.On the page limit, I only got the overload once and I was amazed because the shredder attempted to auto-correct itself by throwing it in reverse and then forward into the jam was cleared.  And it did clear the jam itself without any manual intervention.  I can't say that I counted the number of pages I fed it at a time, but I was feeding it fistfuls of paper and like I say just one jam.Also, I shredded receipts, prescription sheets and all kinds of other irregular paper without problems.  I inserted either vertically or horizontally and it worked either way.The bin size is just fine for me.  I felt I got a good amount of shredding in before I had to empty it.The one wish-list item that I would want which does not affect the rating is that there is no oil-sheet to lubricate the shredder and I hear these can be expensive.  So make sure you find other ways, but I am not there yet.

  basically, when i put the ""on/off"" switch on ""auto"", it runs continuously, whether I am feeding paper into it's mouth or not. It did work fine for the first few months after i got it. After the switch broke ( I am assuming that's what happened, but I am not an electrical engineer), I just continued to use it and turn it off and on manually. I would like it replaced and if you want the broken one back, please send me a label...though, I don't have a box big enough for it. Please advice.  Thank you.

  I shred junk mail like it's a part time job. Seriously, someone must've been trolling my family and I and signed us up for every freakin' mailer available to my area and a few randos for good measure.Still living pre-00's and have wall to wall carpeting everywhere? No problem! Little wheels work on my slightly shaggy carpet no problem. YAY!The unit is quite tall but fits comfortably under my desk and it's not that high, maybe a tad higher than your average banquet table. Bonus: You can sit your lazy bum in your computer chair and not have to bend so far to feed the shredder. I say that's a win any day.Best quality: It's QUIET. Didn't realize how loud and rumbly my 3-ish year-old Walmart special was until I plugged in this guy. Super happy about that! No longer scaring my poor hamster with the shredder from hell.All in all so far it's a great product!

  Update: After over a year, the shredder is still working great. I use this in my kitchen to shred junk mail or anything with my address. It will zip through a typical 3 to 4 page credit card solicitation in seconds. A few staples are no problem either. If you put more than 6 pages, the motor bogs down but will slowly chew through it- I've done that a few times where it just stopped. There is a reverse switch to unclog it if you get overzealous in your shredding. It is usually faster to just put 3 pages in at a time. It has a credit card slot and has no problem chopping them up. There is a safety switch on the back that only allows the shredder to work while in the supplied can (this prevents chopped fingers if you don't unplug it while cleaning the teeth out; BUT if you want to shred into a bigger container, you aren't able to.)Great deal on a cross-cut general purpose shredder. In this day and age, there is no excuse for not making sure your personal information is secure. No paper/junk mail/etc goes in my trash without going through this shredder first.

  I couldn’t wait to receive my new shredder, but was disappointed when I unboxed it. The two boxes it arrived in (printer box inside Amazon box) were completely undamaged, no marks or dents, but as soon as I pulled out the drawer I noticed it was broken. The top was broken and hanging down, which made it a little difficult to pull out the drawer, and there were actually shredded pieces of paper inside. This tells me that they tried to sell me a used product. I’m very unhappy. The part that really stinks is that if I order another one I will have to wait 1 to 2 months for it to arrive. Not cool, especially since I only had to wait about a week for this one. I’m thinking I may go with another brand just to bypass the long shipping time. If you’re going to try to pass used products as new, at least have someone qualified enough to check them to make sure it’s at least empty of garbage. I gave it 2 stars only because it seemed okay otherwise. Nice and sturdy, wheels on bottom to easily move it around, and easy to pick up without having the top come off like other shredders.

  Had a Fellowes shredder that only took two pages per insertion but it lasted 20+ years in my home office. Finally died. Decided on this one because my needs are now less, it had decent features and the price was right. Sorry about the choice.First day in the house I tried a 9 page insertion even though it's supposedly capable of 12. I'm always skeptical of that claim. It took 9 but groaned. So I dropped to 6. Took 6 one time. The next time it jammed completely. Would not reverse to regurgitate the jammed paper and would not continue the shred. Total stop. I then spent 30 minutes pulling jammed paper bits out with a long-nosed tweezer from the top and bottom. Turned it off for 30 minutes. Turned it on. Nothing. That's it for me. If an item conks out in the first minutes of use I'm not going to keep trying. Sent it back. Will probably buy another Fellowes for more money.

  It is a paper shredder.... not much more to say than that except do not go even one page over the recommended limit. This will clog up and shut down. I shredded probably 5 batches of 5 sheets each and it overheated. I shredded one page over the limit, and it clogged up and shut down. Update: After using this for a second time, it stopped working. I notice Amazon's products and recommended are cheap junk with bot -created reviews. Is it really possible that over 3,000 people bought this specific shredder and gave it a good review? Junk.

  Horrid. Horrid. Horrid. Do not waste your money or time. You will only have to  return it. The credit card slot stopped working. The shredder only works on one side. You can’t get an entire sheet of paper through.Stephanie and Danny from Customer Service’s Tech Support for the shredder are terrible to deal with. They interrupt and it took all of my strength not to sound like a sailor. They made me VERY stressed.The product is horrid and why you would want your customers to have a bad experience is beyond me.

  I""m so glad I got this paper shredder.  I'd had a shredder some years ago that was such a dud that I had a hard time imagining one working well for such a reasonable price.  It's swift, efficient, and effective, and unlike the machines I shopped in Staples, it feels very solid.  Now I can dispatch in seconds those papers that need to be destroyed.

  AmazonBasics are generally good quality items....this is no exception.  The 8-sheet shredder is powerful and well made and perfectly complements a small or home office environment. Controls are simple and easy to use. I replaced my $200 Fellowes shredder with the $35 AmazonBasics shredder and I wasn't disappointed. The collection bin is half the size of my old shredder but I knew it's capacity before I bought it.  This just means that I will have to empty the shredder more than I did before. This is one reason why it probably wouldn't work well in a large office environment. I haven't tried more than 8 sheets of standard copy paper but why risk a jam.  I generally limit my shreds to 4 / 5 pieces of paper at a time and this shredder eats them up.

  There isn’t much that can go wrong with these things unless you abuse them by stuffing paper or multiple charge cards into it. We used it conservatively, only shredding envelopes or bill statements, one at the time. We emptied it as needed. One day it simply stopped working. We tried to unclog the roller device inside but it could not be repaired for any less than it is worth. Three months later, we have to replace it. If you’re looking at this model, I strongly recommend you look further unless you don’t mind it’s ridiculously short shelf life.

  I give this shredder three and a half stars.  I think it's solid overall and should last a long time.  The build quality seems good, and I don't notice any weakness in this area.  The noise level is ""ok.""  It's definitely quieter than the 10-year old Fellowes shredder it replaced, but I don't find the new sound level to be anything groundbreaking.  I haven't had the troubles of closing the bin like others have.  I keep a trash bag in it, and every once in awhile it won't close all the way.  I just give it a tap or adjust the bag, and it's fine.  The one annoyance I have that bothers me is the size or angle of the opening for the paper to shred.  I find the opening to be too narrow for my liking, and if I have any more than approximately five papers, I find it difficult to insert them.  The opening itself is at a slight angle, as well, so I have to try to angle the papers in, or I have to make sure each paper in the stack is straightened really well.  Even a single receipt can be slightly frustrating at times.  With my Fellowes, the opening was easily accessible, straight up and down at the top.  I found that design to be easier and more user friendly.  The other half star I took off was because there are deals on other shredders that are micro-cut where this one isn't.  This does shred small, so it's not a complete deal breaker.  The bottom line I ask myself is:  Would I buy it again?  And in this case, no, I don't think I would.  It does work well, and it will get the job done, so if it's at a great price compared to others and you don't use it that much, sure go for it.  But the next time I personally shop for one, I will look for one that is easier to feed, that's micro cut, and one that is even quieter if possible.  Best of luck.

  Very happy with my purchase. Great addition for our household and my small biz shredding needs.Pros: It makes quick work of shredding. It's quieter than I anticipated (MUCH quieter than my last one/diff brand). So far, even with shredding tons of stuff, it hasn't hit an overheat phase (giving it a break every couple of minutes). Easily shreds old credit cards. I even threw in a few pieces of junk mail, envelope and all. Great little machine has pulverized everything I've put in it so far. I trust Amazon to stand behind their branded products.Cons: Says it can shred up to 12 pages at once; really slows down when shredding just 7 so I won't tempt anything more at one time. Would prefer a larger bin; knew what I was getting but I'm emptying the bin far more than I anticipated. May be because it cross cuts vs. regular shredder I am used to.Overall - very happy with the product and the price.

  I had several file cabinets worth of shredding to accomplish over a weekend.  I did not want to spend $$$ on a shredder, so I opted for this model.  I was concerned that it would overheat, but it worked like a champ!  I shredded about 10-12 bins worth in one day and it NEVER overheated!  It did jam a few times when I pushed the 12-sheet limit, but I was able to get that resolved.  I do wish the bin was larger, but overall, I am very happy with this shredder and I think it is excellent for the ~$50 price point.

  Fire Danger.  I have found this shredder running and very hot when I have not been in the room  It has started by itself several times.  It gets very very hot when running for an extended period of time and I believe it could catch on fire.  I have unplugged it and use it only as a wast basket now.  This product should not be sold until they figure out what causes it to start running for no reason.  No there was no paper scraps in the blades and I had not used it for days when it started to run by itself.  DANGER.

  I bought this after considering a much more expensive brand. It's a powerful little machine that fully supports my mission to switch my home office to paperless records and it fits under my desk!. This would have been a 5 star review except for the poor design of the bin door. It has a very small plastic gadget that must be in place for the door to properly shut. It took me a while to figure this out as this piece fell into the bin when I closed the door the first time. This caused a red light on the shredder and rendered it inoperable. When I finally realized the problem and found the gadget, I used Superglue to permanently secure it.

  This works great! I don't typically test it with the full 8-sheet capacity, but I regularly put mail through that hasn't been opened yet, such as credit card offers, and it handles them just fine. I finally got rid of the huge stack of mail that had been building up on my counter because I didn't want to throw it away but I had lent my old shredder to a friend and never got it back. So, after some research I finally bit the bullet and bought a new one. I do like the cross-cut as my old one just did the strips. I feel this one is more secure, but it's not like I'm shredding secret government documents or million-dollar bank statements. Still, it would take some serious effort to try to put these bits back together.I did try shredding a credit card and although it slowed a bit, it handled it. You just have to do those one at a time. I also put through stacks of paper and even if some of them got fed in at a bit of an angle, it didn't jam and everything went through fine. Again, it slows a bit, but that's fine as long as it doesn't jam.The first day I got it, I used it for about a half hour and it didn't overheat or shut off. I pretty much filled up it on the first round and it was a trooper. I know you can put bags in it but since I just use it for paper, I simply empty it into my other recycle bag when it's full and ready to go out. That's better anyway since the bags are recyclable and I'm trying to be better about that.This could also be used to make packing paper as the shredded bits would pack nicely around breakable items. Or, you could shred some pretty colored paper to make your own stuffing for presents. Or confetti. The possibilities are endless and I'm sure someone has made a Pinterest board about it.All in all, I'm pretty happy with this and would recommend it. I've had good luck with the Amazon brand.

  This shredder broke down within 8 months of purchase and under infrequent (once per week) use.  The shredder suddenly stopped ingesting the paper no matter the sheet count (one or two sheets, etc.). We never abused this shredder nor feed more than 4 sheets at a time; it should last longer than 8 months under light use!I tried to fix it by taking the engine components, cleaning them, etc. to no avail. I just wasted an hour of my time doing that.While it was operational it worked as expected; but I cannot recommend it due to its poor longevity.

  Have had no issues, shreds fine. As one noted, some things shred where you can read some words....I doubt most are going to go to that much trouble to dig through your garbage to piece it all together [unless you're in some trouble with the law, and in that case-I suggest you burn your documents :P]. Most of it was broken up and made no sense, and being mixed with tons of other broken up/made no sense paper [not to mention, many of them where the words weren't readable]...I'm thinking a criminal wanting to steal your identity is going to want an easier target. For me personally, I'm satisfied.I have also shredded up to 6 sheets with no problems, as well as cards. I like that it is compact, but solid and the blades are thick. The top is heavier than I thought it would be, and the waste basket very light. Controls simple and easy.  Will revise if for any reason product doesn't hold up, has malfunctions or breaks, in reasonable time span of course [nothing lives forever].

  After my last shredder bit the dust, I started the unenviable task of looking for a new one.  I've had 5-6 shredders over the years, and while they have gotten better over time, I always end up paying quite a bit for a higher end personal shredder because I've had 2 cheaper ones early on that didn't last.  Even the better, more expensive ones, always struggled to shred the amount of pages they were rated for and had troubles keeping up (I batch shred, I don't have space to keep a shredder plugged in and ready all the time).I was happy to see that Amazon added some shredders to their Basics line.  The Basics line always seems to have great value and decent products.  I purchased this 8 sheet cross-cut shredder for less than half of what I believe I would have purchased a good 'name brand' model for.So far, it's been really good.  I like the simplicity of the shredder unit sitting on top of the waste can portion where the shredded bits go (I've been used to shredders with pull out shred bins that always made a mess and always got bits of paper crammed everywhere inside).  As with any shredder, I basically half the page rating and never put in more than half (in this case with a rating of 8, I never put in more than 4 layers), and it's been doing very well.

  I like this product as much as one can like a shredder. It works as advertised and was priced competitively. The one part of the machine I do not care too much for is the switch...as I tend to like to leave electric devices in the off position, I need to keep pushing the switch to off or on...a minor inconvenience, but an on/off switch would make this a better product. The switch now has all of the modes of operation in a row.

  This shredder jammed after two weeks of occasional home use and no longer works. I was careful not to put more than 10 pages at a time, and I stopped whenever the light indicated it was overheated.  The paper became stuck in the blades and it will not work, either reverse or forward.  The bit is constructed such that you cannot take it apart.  As the instructions indicated for a severe jam, I tried to put shredder oil in the blades, waited 30 minutes and tried again.  Nothing.  I will be sending this back and buying a different brand.

  I have purchased several different items under the ""Amazon Basics"" branding,and have been impressed by the quality of the items for what you pay for them. This shredder is no different. Great quality at a very economical price! The shredder is listed as a 12 sheet, but I kept my paper feed to 8 sheets or less as most bank and credit card statements are in that range.The instructions state that you should give the shredder a 30 minute break after about 7 minutes of continuous run, but this little shredder kept going and going!I filled the 4 gallon bin over a dozen times in less than 3 hours (I was WAY behind on my shredding duties!), and this little workhorse did not overheat or jam once.FIVE STARS for this wonderful shredder!PROS:* Great price for a 12 sheet crosscut shredder* Very simple to use - sliding switch for OFF, FORWARD (continuous), REVERSE (continuous), and AUTO (runs as fed paper)* Indicator lights to show if shredder is on (green), full, misaligned, or overheated (red)* Auto shutoff if overheating to protect motor.* Quiet operationCONS:None that I can speak of!RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USERS:* Be kind to your shredder! If you are shredding heavy, stop at half basket intervals (or when you hear the shredder slowing down), unplug the shredder, lift the head off the basket, and clear the shredded paper. It keeps the shredder working at optimal speed.* I highly recommend that you also purchase the 'Amazon' branded 'lubricating / sharpening sheets'.. They are easy to use (just shred one after every 30 minutes of service, and then activate the 'reverse' function for 10 seconds). This will keep you shredder's blades sharp and lubricated and protect your investment.SUMMARY:I highly recommend this shredder. Amazon also offers a 6 or 8 sheet shredder, but I think the 12 sheet model is worth the extra $10-$15, especially if you are shredding stuff like credit card offers without even opening the envelope. I'm not sure that the 6 or 8 sheet models would handle that task as quickly, and when it comes to shredding, I just want to get it done without delays or jams.For anyone considering this shredder, I hope this information has been helpful! Peace.

  I purchased this immediately after returning Amazon's more basic version because I was afraid the documents weren't being destroyed enough. This unit certainly met me expectations for that. See photo for average shredded profile. Unfortunately the 'Auto' featured failed within a few weeks. And finally 3 years later the until will no longer operate. Light use, usually only 1-3 sheets at a time. Maybe once a month. My other complaint would be that the credit card slot is completely the wrong direction as it allowed the entire card number to but output when shredded given the direction and shredded profile. Works great for most documents and credit/debit cards if turned 90 degrees to separate all numbers.

  Will only give it 3 stars, since it arrived broken. The reason for breakage was that the little plastic  tab attached to the door and which activates the shredder had broken off. The shredder will not work without it and gives a message that the door is not closed, even when it is. For such an important function, they could have made this small plastic piece sturdier than it is.. Amazon replaced the shredder and the actual functioning of the machine is fine, but I am mindful of this thin plastic tab when I open and close the door. I also want to note that the shredder is heavy.

  SAYS it's made for home office,  I guess because if it was a commercial office it would cost to much labor to operate it.  SORRY BUT apparently Amazon basics means CHEAP JUNK.  The shredder  has a deep intake slot probably for safety. If it struggles, it reverses and jams the intake slot WHICH IS almost impossible to clear.  It says 12  sheets, I say caution at 10.  Not sure this one will survive the home office.  OK, my fault for ordering on line from Amazon.  This is the first thing I purchased that was branded Amazon, yes made in China... GRRRR  their return policy sucks or I would trade it for better.  If I return it for exchange I get the same junk again.  The freight for return for credit would eat up the price, its heavy.  DO NOT BUY.

  I hesitated paying up for this shedder but after using it I'm convinced it was money well spent.  First off, the little things: It will run in auto mode - shove a paper in the slot and it sheds it. Or constant mode - turn it on and let it rip.  When shedding large projects this makes a huge difference and it is easier on the motor.  Then there is the window in the bin.  Lets you know exactly how full it is.  The bin seems small, but that's because this thing is fast.  I had a pile if documents that look taller than two reams of paper.  I had to empty the bin 5 times but I was done in less than 20 minutes.  Finally, it is very quiet.  Low motor noise so all you get to hear is the satisfying crunch of paper going through the knives.  I recommend this shredder highly.

  About a week ago my shredder would automatically turn on and stay on until I switched it off. I contacted Amazon Service and they said that because I had shredded address labels, that may have affected the sensor, which was now causing the shredder to automatically turn on. They also informed me that because I had shredded labels, I had automatically voided my warranty. Their only suggestion? Try cleaning the slot where you insert paper with alcohol. If that doesn't work then, you'll have to just manually turn it on/off when you want to use it. That's it. Prior to this shredder I owned a FELLOWS shredder which lasted 10+ years. Silly me for switching brands and assuming that Amazon would make a shredder that would  shred labels. The fact is I don't really know  if it's because of the labels I shredded or a defective sensor and thanks to Amazon, I'll never know. AND... I'll never buy another Amazon Basics item  ever again. Amazon... you just lost a loyal Amazon Prime customer. Shame on you!

  ... and those are about the only positive things I can say for it.The list shortcomings of this shredder are taller than the short squat can it comes with.  To start, I ran about 12 sheets of paper through it one at a time and the can was already about 1/2 full.  It wouldn't take a lot more pages before I'd have to empty it.  And then, there's the narrow, tiny, little feed slot.  Read the specification carefully.  It is only 0.2"" wider than a standard sheet of paper.  Plus, the feed isn't vertical.  You have to come in at a 45-degree angle to get the paper into the feed to activate it.  I really don't know how you could fit 12 sheets of paper in there at a time unless they were very neatly stacked and compressed together.  (I didn't try it, as I was leary of it jamming up.)It works as described, but not all that great.  I guess AmazonBasics is finally at the point where they've put the ""basic"" into the product instead of quality or usability.

  I do not recommend purchasing this shredder. I just purchased the shredder less than three weeks ago and after shredding less than 30 pieces of paper it has completely shut down and is non-functional. I was very excited to use the shredder for at least six months to year. The worst part is that I've attempted to return the shredder to Amazon for a replacement considering this may just be a lemon shredder. Amazon is stating that is outside the window for return which is shocking considering it is less than 2 to 3 weeks since I received it. Amazon usually is very good about returning or replacing dysfunctional faulty products. In this case scenario I have lost $40 for a useless product that I can't even return despite having had it for just less than three weeks. I usually expect way more than this from from an ""Amazon basic product"" which came with extremely high reviews from Amazon.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHREDDER.

  TL;DR: Spend a few more dollars for something more reliable.Bought Dec 2015 and only used roughly twice per month shredding a small amount of paper each time (receipts, letters with personal information, etc.), but started developing issues within a year where the motor would not stop. Every time time we'd ""fix"" it by using a cotton swap to clean around the sensor area, usually several rounds of cleaning at 5-15 mins total. We've lubricated the machine regularly with shredder oil, and always cleaned it on a regularly basis.After suffering the Stockholm Syndrome for over a year, I finally realized that I could've spent a bit more to buy a better shredder instead of putting up with this every few weeks. A shredder that's barely used should not develop problems this quickly, no matter how inexpensive it is.

  I originally ordered this product and received it January 26, 2018. I used it maybe five times, each time shredding no more than 2 pages at a time (even though it claims to be an 8-sheet shredder) over an extended period of time. The unit stopped working without cause on Feb. 13, 2018.I received a free replacement on Feb. 17, 2018, as it was within the 30 day warranty period. However, the replacement item was barely used between March and April and on April 27, 2018, it stopped working (same as the original unit).Given both the original unit and the replacement performed poorly and came no where near meeting my expectations, I do not recommend this product. If you're going to spend over $30 on a shredder, get something reliable that you won't have to replace every month!

  Shredder would not power on right out of the box and had to return.  Appears not to have been tested prior to shipping as there was no evidence of paper shreds or dust in the collection bin.  This is a very large heavy shredder and it was difficult to take to my local UPS store to ship back.  Customer service was great however and I received my refund immediately.  Ended up buying a new shredder locally.

  I purchased this shredder despite some bad reviews but the unit has proven to work quite well.  To be realistic, one cannot expect a shredder priced under $100 to be industry grade and be able to run non-stop for over 30 minutes without over heating.  For a normal house hold this works fine.  Obviously the user should not load more than 8 normal thickness of paper at one time (or less if the paper is extra thick).  I shredded a big pile of old paperwork, with intermittent pauses to look at the statements, and the unit did not over heat.  Slightly off center feeds were not a problem.. And the cross cut provides higher security than the strip cuts, although not quite as good as the micro cut.  But again, good enough for a normal household.Will update if performance changes over time.

  Product was exactly as discribed. I was a little worried after reading reviews of it over heating or not working at all. I thought I'd try it for the price, and my worries were immediately put to rest. I cleaned out my file cabinet. I apparently tossed an envelope that had a dime in it. It made a horrendous noise, and I immediately turned it off. I put it in reverse and out popped a dime. The dime was a little ate up, but the shredder still works perfectly. It went on to shred these two bags, and another almost full bag still in the canister. It also shredded several credit cards and IDs like it was nothing. I did almost 3 full canisters (periodically pushing down the shredded material) in one sitting. It did get a little warm, which is to be expected. It was by no means hot or anything I was remotely worried about. I also turn it off when it's not in use. There is a customer service number on the machine. Will update if I encounter any issues, though I doubt I will.

  Have had this for seven months. Jams from time to time and can be unjammed by running back and forth in reverse and forward. However, for some reason I thought it was an 8 page shredder and never loaded more than 6 sheets at a time. After home use for seven months the plastic handle came off. It is held in place by 4 small screws that are screwed in holes in the plastic. It is what is used to take off the cover which holds all the weight of the motor and blades. If you have to take the cover apart to expose the innards there are about 6 screws to try to find including one that is hidden by a warning tag and 3 or 4 that are concealed in recessed holes. Worst of all is that Amazon Basics does not stock replacement for the plastic handle. Buy a different brand since repair parts are lacking from Amazon Basics. For the sake of some inappropriate cheap plastic used where a more heavy duty handle and better attachment method, Amazon Basics destroyed what could have been a fair product.

  Granted I've had this shredder for over 5 years and it's worked well with very limited use but, in my opinion, I believe it nearly caused my house to burn down! I just came home from being at work all day and when I walked in the house I immediately heard a very loud ""machine"" noise I did not recognize. Starting to panic as it got louder as I got closer to the source, I found this shredder in our home office running all by itself for no reason. There was nothing jammed in the feed slot that could have caused it to activate automatically. It had apparently been running for hours as it was nearly hot enough to melt the plastic the case was made of and smelled of a strong electrical burning smell. It sounded terrible, like the motor was about to seize up. I have used Amazon Basics products before and never had a problem, but I seriously doubt I will ever buy another electrical product by Amazon Basics. This thing was very dangerous.

  It does the job and does it fast! We own a notary business and print packets up to 200 pages each multiple times a day. When something goes awry with printing or an appointment get cancelled post printing, we have a lot of shredding to do to protect our client’s personal information. This shredder is fast, and can handle shredding two sets of 200 page packets without overheating or getting jammed when shredding up to 20 pages at a time. I have to empty the bin more often than I would like to, but so far, that’s my only complaint. Hands down one of my favorite, most therapeutic pieces of home office equipment

  The shredder does exactly what it says it will do and if you jam it, it's probably your own fault. This is great for destroying mail or personal information in moderation. This product would not work for politicians attempting to hide unscrupulous campaign finance histories.

  The only issue here is the sensor for the hopper keeps saying it is full. You have to jiggle it around to get the sensor to realize that the hopper is empty. I attempted to get warranty service. They responded that I had to correct my email address since it was purchased on a different email account. I did do this and responded to them that it was under my account. To date, now 3 weeks since I responded to them, I have heard no word. Good price. HORRIBLE customer service. The thing is worthless because the sensor thinks it is full all the time so I cannot use it. I haven't shredded anything for over 2 months now.They finally got back to me and refunded the money that I spent on this. I have purchased another brand.

  Very nice product.  Used it extensively the first day and was very pleased with results.  Didn't overheat and handled 8 sheets with ease.

  When something says it will shred credit cards, I expect it to do as it claims.  It didn't.  Now it won't work.  I was going to return it, but the shipping alone is more expensive than what I paid for the shredder.  No thank you.  As far as the rating,  the shredder itself is sturdy, but I WILL NOT SHRED CREDIT CARDS.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  In this day and time, that is one of the most important things to shred.

   This is a great machine at an even better price! It will only shred 6 pages at a time, so if you have a business where you need to shred a good amount each day-you might consider getting one of the 12-page shredders. I just went through a stack of documents about 2 inches thick and had to mash the shreds down. When I mashed them down it was only half full in the container. It comes with a small container. As you can see from the pictures, the entire shredder is about the same size as my computer tower. It fits under my desk very well. One of the things I really like about this is that I do not have to buy expensive oil for the machine. The instructions say I can just use vegetable oil once a month! I also like that it came with a flyer saying that the product had already been tested and might have some paper scraps left in it. I like that each unit is tested- lowers your chances of getting a lemon and having to go through the hassle to exchange it! I am impressed with the product and would gladly buy another if needed.

  I have now been through 3 of these shredders. Each one failed for the same reason: the reverse function was inoperative, both auto and manual. This third machine basically failed right out of the box! I was shredding only 12 sheets at a time. After 15 minutes the ""overload"" light came on, but the machine failed to auto-reverse. The manual reverse also failed to work, so there it was, with 12 sheets half in the slot and half still sticking out. Without the reverse function it is impossible to remove the unshredded sheets as they are firmly ""locked"" in the shredding teeth.This unit is rated for 24 sheets of 20 lb paper at a time, 40 minutes run time before 50 minutes ""rest.""  It could not handly even 12 sheets at a time for 15 minutes.I'm returning this for credit, as I have no faith that a 4th unit will work any better. As this is an ""Amazon Basics"" item, Amazon should have direct access to the manufacturers and should inform them that they can no longer carry this product.Kudos to Amazon's generous return policy!

  If I could give this six stars I would. What a great trouble free hard worker. I went though a lot of old documents, three large trash bags full. The beast never complained nor shut off! (There were breaks for my sorting.) It shredded plastic cards easily and the see through window is helpful. The wheels are nice as you can just role it to your work space. If this product is indicative of Amazon Basics, I will look there first in the future. Shipping was fast and the shredder came double boxed. Shipping trucks ""vary""  so double boxed  was a good thing as well! I notice some had a problem with the door. You don't want it to run with the door open clearly but, I had no problem with the door staying shut.

  Within the first couple of minutes of normal use, the machine started throwing a horrendous knocking noise as it shredded. I looked at the underside of the shredder head and saw a huge crack in the plastic, causing it to be deformed and hit the shredder blades. Either the machine completely split apart during normal use (that's bad) or it shipped with a large crack that opened up once the blades started moving (also bad).I'm returning it for a replacement, because I need a shredder, but I'd avoid this machine and the ""Amazon"" brand in the future if I were a smarter shopper.

  I wore out a Fellowes shredder after many years. This looked like a good deal for a cross-cut shredder and indeed it was. Works fine, as expected. Shreds into pretty much paper mush. I don't run more than three sheets at a time, though; that seems to be a reasonable upper limit. After a straight hour's shredding it never overheated.Can't complain one bit.

  I tested the shredder when it came. Then I left it off. Now, when I turn it on, the green light is on, but the shredder does not sense the paper that's placed in. No motion at all. Of course, I don't have the original box it came in. Can't return it.

  The Shredder is listed as a light/medium duty but I used it to shred a lot when I first used it. So far it has done a great job shredding. I've run two box loads of old documents (8 1/2"" x 11"" sheets of paper piled about 18"" high) thru the shredder. Enough to fill five 13 gallon trash bags of firmly compacted shreds. I never ran the eight max sheets but kept it to five of less. With thicker sheets, I just ran a single sheet thru. I also tried to avoid running staples thru even though it's OK to do so. The machine never jammed or overheated and turned itself off. I never ran it more than 3 minutes at a time anyways and would use it sporadically to not overheat it. The feed slot is at an angle but you get used to it quickly. The sensor is electronic, not a flimsy plastic tab sticking out triggered by a sheet of paper. To keep it oiled I just poured some mineral oil on a sheet of paper and ran it thru the cutters.The switch has a lot of side to side play but it does the job. It does have a decent click when seated in one of three positions. Auto, Off, or Reverse. The 4.1 gallon bin is a little soft and flimsy so handle it carefully. The window is nice to see how full the bin is getting. A little gentle shaking helps settle the shreds down as you go. The thinner the paper the better job it does crosscutting. Still it shreds enough for home use. The handle makes emptying the bin a lot easier.

  Bought this about 10 months ago, and it seemed to be working fine until it wouldn't even turn on. When I called the toll free customer service number conveniently provided on the top of the unit - guess what - it was fine - I just hadn't made sure the half moon shaped piece of plastic on the back of the unit was over the edge of the bucket. This meant that the safety cut-off switch wasn't disengaged, which meant the unit wouldn't work BECAUSE of SAFETY! LOL This was the first question the customer service rep asked me, so I'm not the only person who has called. So before you give this unit a bad review, check out that you're using it correctly!

  Less than a year it completely broke. The covers themselves broke around the screws.I get things break but less than a year isn't a good sign.I decided to get the 8 page version of this but have about a year before I review that one. Stay tuned!

  Forget 8 sheet... it has been jamming with 4 or 5... and will not take an unopened prepaid credit card offer, which in my opinion should be the standard.Largely 2 stars because once this thing gets jammed... it is almost impossible to unjam because of the plastic silver/white cover over the shred blades put there for your protection.... I had 5 pieces of paper end up getting pulled crooked and it jammed. The fragment of paper that caused the jam was positioned so you can't get to it from the top or the bottom, and the unit immediately refuses to operate, the ""Overheat"" light comes on which isn't really an overheat.. just means it has detected a jam and refuses to try to power through it because it might overheat. The only way to get to the blades to actually clear the jam would be to void the warranty by removing the last screw to open the top unit up.My suggestion is to skip a shredder... just throw it all on the Webber... fire never jams.

  I bought this specifically for preparing cardboard to be composted. The unit is powerful and has no problem shredding down cardboard boxes. My only complaint is that during normal operations the unit will frequently stop running and indicate that the bin is full when it is not. Tapping on the top of the machine causes it to resume shredding. I suspect there is a faulty connection or sensor causing the issue. I didn’t want to bother with returning it so I am just using it. If it stops working entirely I will take it apart and disable the bin full sensor. It is a powerful and relatively inexpensive shredder for cardboard that apparently has poor quality control.

   Reviewing the 12-sheet Amazon Basics paper shredder. In picture: small Aurora 4-sheet shredder (AS420C) and 7-gallon (15-inch-tall) recycling bin included for size reference. Black 12-sheet shredder is in the middle. This thing eats cardboard easily. Great shredder. Not too tall, not too small. The capacity is generous. A little bit too much for my needs, but I highly recommend it for anyone who has big piles of paper needing to be shredded. It's a little loud but not too bad, but it is super heavy. (But not necessarily heavier than the average 12-sheet shredder I assume, so don't let that steer you away) I'm going to stick with the 4-sheet Aurora shredder because even though it can't handle the thick Amazon-box cardboard like this 12-sheet shredder can, it's at least strong enough to cut through thin-style cardboard.

  Whether you’re a college student or a professional that needs something for the office, this shredder doesn’t disappoint. I really like the cross-cut feature because it utilizes more bin space. This means that it’ll be able to hold more shreds of paper. It’s powerful and reliable and I haven’t had any problems with it since. I use it quite often and have only had to empty it once (out of the 4 months I’ve had it for). Its compact size makes it perfect for storing in tight spaces. Amazon claims that it’ll keep shredding for around 3 minutes before overheating with the rest time estimated at 30 minutes. Sounds like a long time, but then again you can’t expect grade A performance on a budget shredder. I personally never ran into any overheating issues, but if you’re someone that does a lot of routine shredding and in large batches, then I’d suggest looking at a higher end model. Overall, it’s a quality product and definitely worth the investment given the price point and features.

  I bought this to replace one from a big box office supply store that failed after about 5 years.  This one is essentially exactly the same as my other one - same cross-cut, same footprint, same features, about the same price.  It does have one better design feature, the fact that the little handhold in the front, the hand-sized opening in the trashcan part allows you to easily see when it is filling up.  The ONLY reason I took one star off is because of what I'm assuming is a safety feature, which I just find annoying:  In my previous model, you could walk up to the shredder and just feed the paper right in, nothing special, in it went.  On this one, there is not a direct, vertical feed option - the feed area has a ""cover"" of sorts built into it that requires you to feed the paper in practically horizontal to the unit.  I'm absolutely certain this is on purpose, to prevent small fingers and such from getting dragged in.  But I find it a bit annoying.

  I had a hand-me-down paper shredder from my dad that was probably 20 years old, and the auto function, well, didn't function.I tend to accumulate a stack of mail and documents that need shredding then do it all in one go. With the old one, I had to let it run the entire time, so as far as I'm concerned, this thing is awesome.Mainly, the auto function functions. So on the occasions that I do just have one paper to get rid of, I can just process it without having to switch it on. It can handle a decent amount of papers too. I don't make a habit of this but I've just thrown entire envelopes into this thing and, you can hear it working but it chows through them without slowing down. It can also eat credit cards or similar plastics without an issue. It has a designated slot for cards but I'm not sure that it matters all that much.I like that it has a cross-cut function, just to make it extra difficult for dedicated trash-spies to tape together a discarded credit card offer or bank statement.It also has a reverse function, just in case you get halfway through a document and realize you still need the top half.An added benefit is the safety triggers, where if you pull the unit out of the container, it will cease to function until it is back in its place. Or at least the triggers are pressed.It's Amazon Basics and it is better than basic for me, so I'm thoroughly pleased with it, and I've had it for several months at this point. Not bad at $35 either.

  My husband and I finally hit the point of ""we can shred anything older than ______"". So we went through all our paperwork, Did some Marie Kondo on reorganizing the stuff we needed to keep. And ended up with 4 paper boxes that needed to be shredded. Realizing we would need a shredder long term going forwarded, we landed on this due to the great reviews and longevity others had mentioned.  I got this shredder on Tuesday and as of tonight (2 days later), this shredder has helped me finish 4 paper boxes into 4 garbage bags FULL.  We're talking about 5,000 pages of statements, bills, records, files, and stubs.  This thing is noisy, but it stops if it is tipped or not inserted to the can accurately, has a warning light if it gets too hot (only happened once in all my hours of shredding), can handle staples like a champ, and no papers got stuck.  Only downside - the can is small - but that wont be an issue for our daily/weekly shredding. It's only a big deal for this big project. VERY HAPPY!!!!

  This shredder is advertised and sold as a cross shredder but I noticed it is not.  In fact, when I looked at the small shredded pieces I could see a good part of personal info like my name, account numbers etc.  All it does Is cut the papers into to small rectangular pieces. After doing research I see I should get a micro shredder. That too takes research.

  Very good value for this Amazon Basic cross cutter.  States 12 sheets of 20-lb bond paper tho that's chancing everyone knows the limits of that.  I've tried that but it's pushing it a bit considering you have 7-min max limit to then allow a cool down period of 30-min.  Granted most aren't going to be purging years, if so this isn't the right model.  Periodic as mail comes in or a weekly shredding is plenty good and make sure to get proper lubricant to keep it running sharp.  I'm a but lazy as I buy the prepped sheets with lubricant and sharpening properties.  I'd had liked outside bucket handles to carry both the shredder and bucket, but you can't have it all on a value model, tho having what's important is provided.  Read the instructions thoroughly before using is the best advice given.  I'm a fan and user of this product.  Thank you for reading.

  I just got the shredder, and have been using it almost all day. So far it hasn’t overheated, there isn’t a huge mess, and it shreds perfectly. I’ve had shutters before that didn’t cut the paper or items small enough, and I worried about someone digging through my trash and finding important information. I’m someone that works in the field that everything that I signed or has to do with a client needs to be shredded, as well as bills Social Security number, and any bank statements or items that have my information get shredded. I’ve had my bank Information taken before, and with the shredder I’m confident that it won’t happen again. Also it’s not extremely loud, which helps if you’re a pet owner

  I've been looking for a shredder for a while now since, while fun, burning documents isn't the most practical thing in the world. Luckily, I got this on sale.I was a little apprehensive after seeing reviews of it not working properly, but I wanted to give it a shot. So far, it's been working wonderfully. Even though it's listed as 8 sheets, I don't do more than 4-5 to play safe. It did start to show signs of overheating (I was getting rid of a LOT like old bank statements and theatre scripts i have no use for), so I let it cool down like the instructions stated.The main cons is that it did have chunks stuck after big passes, but I think that was because I was a little careless. And it's easy to clear out. It's also on the small side so you're going to empty it pretty frequently. But that's not a big issue.Overall, I recommend it.Update: A few months later and she's still working marvelously. One recommendation- don't insert big chunky spam mail as it doesn't destroy it entirely.

  So I decided I wanted to get a paper shredder, just to shred the junk mail I’ve been getting lately. I saw this, and the price was enticing and I figured 8-sheet was more than enough for the 3 or 4 letters I get a day. So after going through my mail, opening them up and all, I started shred them one by one. I got to the third letter when I started to smell like something was burning. So I stopped, and unplugged it. I was a little surprised by what happened, and decided I’ll deal with this later when I get home from work. Once I got home, I plugged it back in and stuck the last letter in. The burning smell came back almost immediately, and I saw smoke coming up from where I put in the letter. I immediately unplugged it, with the letter still visible in the slot.I contacted Amazon customer service, which the offered to send a replacement but I’m to wary about getting another one of the same model. Maybe I’ll invest in one that’s a little more powerful, perhaps 8-sheet wasn’t enough for junk mail. I want to make it clear, it’s not like I was shoving thick unopened letters in the shredder. I opened the letters, took out the contents, reviewed them, and then shredded the contents which a max is three pages. If I was shoving unopened letters, I would have put partial blame on myself. However, that’s not the case.I would maybe invest in one slightly stronger model, because 8-sheet just didn’t cut it for 3-sheets.

  Cross-cut is key and Amazon has made this product well, especially for a reasonable price. I consider this AmazonEssential not AmazonBasic. Every household should keep one of these for shredding bills and other sensitive information - these days you need to protest yourself against identity thieves that will go through trash.I've been using this for long enough to feel like it's DEFINITELY worth the money.ProsChews through day to day mail and sensitive information or expired cardsEasy to empty and re-lubricateConsThis is for light home use, it is not intended for bulk jobs in one long session (it's labeled appropriately, and lives up to description)That society necessitates having a shredder at all

  I had a shredder for several years that worked great; it was made by Fellowe's. When Amazon offered me a new model under the Amazon Vine Program, I jumped at it, since my old one was getting on and was several years old.  I figured it couldn't last too much longer.  I had the new one about three months, until the time came to empty the basket for the first time. After I did, it jammed and would not work.  So I adjusted my Vine Review accordingly and ordered this one.  It arrived today.I took it out of the box and read the User Manual thoroughly.  Then I plugged it in and switched it on.  I had several pieces of paper to shred, since I had been without a shredder for almost a week.I fed in the first sheet of paper.  I could hear it shred, but the paper did not advance into the shredder.  I pulled the paper out and noted that the edge of the paper - barely one quarter inch - had been shredded.  I turned the paper around and tried feeding it from the other end, with the same results.So, I pulled out another sheet of paper that needed to be shredded and tried that.  Same thing - the shredder shredded the edge of the paper, but the paper would not advance further into the machine.  I put the shredder back in the box it came in and notified Amazon that I want a refund.When I had opened the box to unpack the latest machine, there was a note from Amazon that said that ""each shredder is tested before it is shipped, so you may notice some paper scraps in the baske""t.  Well, if they'd tested the machine I got, they never would have shipped it.  Because it doesn't work.I wonder if Amazon gets tired of paying the postage on returns for defective products, the same way I get tired of packing them up and shipping them back?  Because this is - believe it or not - the third item I have had to return to Amazon this week.Please fellas - stop sending out defective merchandise!

  I have only had this item a few days now but I am pleased. I did a couple of hours of shredding with no problems. It is easy to set up and empty. What I like best - it is actually quiet. I somehow doubt it would handle 15 pages at a time, however. I personally don't need it to do that so that's not an issue for me,  but for anyone who does, I am skeptical it would suit. I haven't tested its on CDs or credit cards either but feel confident it will do fine.
