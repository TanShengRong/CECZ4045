  I purchased this bad boy for my wife’s home office. Let me start off by saying this thing shreds harder than Andy Brinker from the 1998 classic film Brink. For those of you who don’t know, this 99 min film introduced some of the most unique roller blade shredding ever witnessed. Purchase this and you can be shredding like Andy in no time!Update** after using the the shredder my wife has been walking around the house being very confrontational. She now says things like “Bruh, do you even shred!?” For this reason I have to deduct one star.

  This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,

   PROS: I want to cover first the high-quality and well-built aspects of this paper shredder. I’ve seen other reviews I personally think the garbage can (bottom portion/ container) is well-built. It had zero problem shipping to me in one piece. I’ve tested and this can easily shred 15 to 16 pieces of normal copy paper and probably 12 of the thicker resume paper. Personally I use this to shred cardboard. (with all the boxes that I get from Amazon and/or for business it’s a great for shredding cardboard) and compost it afterwards. If you see in the video and photo attached the shredder has no problem going through very thick cardboard whatsoever.  Think “A hot knife through butter”. I also want to say that the machine is extremely quiet in comparison to other shredders a have owned or currently own. I’ve seen on other reviews people said it was loud. It obviously isn’t going to be silent. Even in comparison to the Amazon basics 8 sheet shredder, it’s about half as quiet as that. That link is below if you don’t need something this heavy-duty as the 12 sheet.Link to the AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper, CD and Credit Card Home Office Shredder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN9NX0I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BlQDDbTFVANXGCONS: My two issues with this shredder. One the bottom canister or garbage can cannot be replaced because of the safety mechanism that is built into the shredder. I realize it’s put there for safety but it’s kind of a pain if it ever cracks or breaks. Two is the opening only measures about 8.75-9 inches. If a larger amount of paper or cardboard is loaded in and isn't square to the opening it can jam. That’s easily resolved with the reverse button on the top of the shredder. I would link to see this same shredder with a 12 inch opening.Bottoms line is I would buy again or recommend to a friend.If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.

  I have gone through two of these now. The first one seemed decent and I blame myself for overworking it one day.  The second one, however, I barely used and was extremely careful in how many documents I put in at once.  This one died after a few months with no warning. It is plugged into a surge protector with other items that still work so it was not a power fluctuation. It was just dead one day with no power or sign of life at all. I am annoyed because it was clearly a defective unit but I am outside any return window.

  I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!

   This shredder works as advertised. In the attached video you can see it shredding a stack of 15 pages of paper, a CD, and a credit card. All seemed to work without incident. As you can see in the video it creates small cross shredded strips that will make reassembly of the original document more difficult. Stacks of documents will compress into thick strips that require some effort to separate.I would like to see paper bags or something to go in the wastebin as I would like to send the shredded material out to recycling without the having to dump it into another bag later.Currently the device has a bit of an oily / burnt smell but I have a feeling that it's lubricant from the factory. I expect that to dissipate and will report back if it does not. I will also report back on any long term issues I have with it.

  Over the years I've used a full-size shredder, a micro-shredder, and now this guy. So far, this is the best one.For starters, if you want a continuous-usage shredder you're not going to find it here. If you need to shred for hours and hours spent the cash for a commercial-strength full-size shredder. If, on the other hand, you're occasionally shredding a contract or credit card statement, this will do the trick nicely.I put this shredder through it's paces immediately upon receiving it, because I bought it to shred a large stack of papers I needed to shred to free up some space (tax returns, credit card statements, etc). The device is POWERFUL for it's size. It's blades are small but mighty. Seriously, you can hear this thing rev up like a little jet engine ready to gobble paper up. You CAN overload it with continuous 6-sheet shreds (it's a bad idea to shred a lot of multi-paper jobs at the max thickness a shredder is rated for), but if you let it breath a little between jobs and only feed it a few pages at a time, it handles it nicely.I expected the device to jam after shredding this huge stack of papers and it did, but I was able to clear it without too much trouble (I wish the opening was a little wider so I could easily pull out stuck paper with needle-nose pliers, but that's the only flaw in the device I found). A few minutes of reverse, forward, reverse, and a few yanks with the pliers and the one jam cleared without further issue.The real nice thing is that this device seems to handle paperclips just fine, and has a nice size waste bin for a product in this low price range.Well, there you have it. I was expected a piece of junk in this price range for very small jobs, and was overjoyed to find this device a step up. It has plenty of power, and shreds beautifully. Just don't try to run it for an hour shredding construction paper, folders, and 6 pages at once. Feed it a few pages at a time or one thick piece at a time and let it cool down every few minutes, and it should last you a good long time. Or at least longer than my last mini-shredder did. That thing is toast.

  ​I purchased this shredder 3 months ago. Love it!I was looking for something basic for my home office.Pros: - Instead of cutting vertically (""strip-cutting""), this shredder chops the sheets both horizontally and vertically (""cross-cut""). Instead of having some long spaghettis of papers, you get some little pieces of spaghettis, much harder for somebody to infer the original content. - Automatic mode: the shredder starts automatically when you insert a sheet (you can disable this behavior). It will stop on its own if you don't insert anything else. - The security trigger locks the shredder as soon you remove the head from the bin. - It doesn't take much room. - Transparent window to see through to know when to empty the bin. - Not noisy.Cons: Nothing for now.Notes:Avoid plastic envelopes/papers. I tried to shred an envelope made of plastic. Pieces of plastic got stuck inside of the blades. It took me 20 minutes to get it clean. That's when the ""reverse"" feature comes handy.I would recommend this item if you need something basic for daily use. If you want something for multiple people, I would go for something bigger.​

You CAN overload it with continuous 6-sheet shreds (it's a bad idea to shred a lot of multi-paper jobs at the max thickness a shredder is rated for), but if you let it breath a little between jobs and only feed it a few pages at a time, it handles it nicely.I expected the device to jam after shredding this huge stack of papers and it did, but I was able to clear it without too much trouble (I wish the opening was a little wider so I could easily pull out stuck paper with needle-nose pliers, but that's the only flaw in the device I found). A few minutes of reverse, forward, reverse, and a few yanks with the pliers and the one jam cleared without further issue.The real nice thing is that this device seems to handle paperclips just fine, and has a nice size waste bin for a product in this low price range.Well, there you have it. I was expected a piece of junk in this price range for very small jobs, and was overjoyed to find this device a step up. It has plenty of power, and shreds beautifully. Just don't try to run it for an hour shredding construction paper, folders, and 6 pages at once. Feed it a few pages at a time or one thick piece at a time and let it cool down every few minutes, and it should last you a good long time. Or at least longer than my last mini-shredder did. That thing is toast.

   PROS: I want to cover first the high-quality and well-built aspects of this paper shredder. I’ve seen other reviews I personally think the garbage can (bottom portion/ container) is well-built. It had zero problem shipping to me in one piece. I’ve tested and this can easily shred 15 to 16 pieces of normal copy paper and probably 12 of the thicker resume paper. Personally I use this to shred cardboard. (with all the boxes that I get from Amazon and/or for business it’s a great for shredding cardboard) and compost it afterwards. If you see in the video and photo attached the shredder has no problem going through very thick cardboard whatsoever.  Think “A hot knife through butter”. I also want to say that the machine is extremely quiet in comparison to other shredders a have owned or currently own. I’ve seen on other reviews people said it was loud. It obviously isn’t going to be silent. Even in comparison to the Amazon basics 8 sheet shredder, it’s about half as quiet as that. That link is below if you don’t need something this heavy-duty as the 12 sheet.Link to the AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper, CD and Credit Card Home Office Shredder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN9NX0I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BlQDDbTFVANXGCONS: My two issues with this shredder. One the bottom canister or garbage can cannot be replaced because of the safety mechanism that is built into the shredder. I realize it’s put there for safety but it’s kind of a pain if it ever cracks or breaks. Two is the opening only measures about 8.75-9 inches. If a larger amount of paper or cardboard is loaded in and isn't square to the opening it can jam. That’s easily resolved with the reverse button on the top of the shredder. I would link to see this same shredder with a 12 inch opening.Bottoms line is I would buy again or recommend to a friend.If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.

  This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,

  ​I purchased this shredder 3 months ago. Love it!I was looking for something basic for my home office.Pros: - Instead of cutting vertically (""strip-cutting""), this shredder chops the sheets both horizontally and vertically (""cross-cut""). Instead of having some long spaghettis of papers, you get some little pieces of spaghettis, much harder for somebody to infer the original content. - Automatic mode: the shredder starts automatically when you insert a sheet (you can disable this behavior). It will stop on its own if you don't insert anything else. - The security trigger locks the shredder as soon you remove the head from the bin. - It doesn't take much room. - Transparent window to see through to know when to empty the bin. - Not noisy.Cons: Nothing for now.Notes:Avoid plastic envelopes/papers. I tried to shred an envelope made of plastic. Pieces of plastic got stuck inside of the blades. It took me 20 minutes to get it clean. That's when the ""reverse"" feature comes handy.I would recommend this item if you need something basic for daily use. If you want something for multiple people, I would go for something bigger.​

  I shred junk mail like it's a part time job. Seriously, someone must've been trolling my family and I and signed us up for every freakin' mailer available to my area and a few randos for good measure.Still living pre-00's and have wall to wall carpeting everywhere? No problem! Little wheels work on my slightly shaggy carpet no problem. YAY!The unit is quite tall but fits comfortably under my desk and it's not that high, maybe a tad higher than your average banquet table. Bonus: You can sit your lazy bum in your computer chair and not have to bend so far to feed the shredder. I say that's a win any day.Best quality: It's QUIET. Didn't realize how loud and rumbly my 3-ish year-old Walmart special was until I plugged in this guy. Super happy about that! No longer scaring my poor hamster with the shredder from hell.All in all so far it's a great product!

  I have gone through two of these now. The first one seemed decent and I blame myself for overworking it one day.  The second one, however, I barely used and was extremely careful in how many documents I put in at once.  This one died after a few months with no warning. It is plugged into a surge protector with other items that still work so it was not a power fluctuation. It was just dead one day with no power or sign of life at all. I am annoyed because it was clearly a defective unit but I am outside any return window.

  I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!

   This shredder works as advertised. In the attached video you can see it shredding a stack of 15 pages of paper, a CD, and a credit card. All seemed to work without incident. As you can see in the video it creates small cross shredded strips that will make reassembly of the original document more difficult. Stacks of documents will compress into thick strips that require some effort to separate.I would like to see paper bags or something to go in the wastebin as I would like to send the shredded material out to recycling without the having to dump it into another bag later.Currently the device has a bit of an oily / burnt smell but I have a feeling that it's lubricant from the factory. I expect that to dissipate and will report back if it does not. I will also report back on any long term issues I have with it.

  Returned after three days. It had the worst time trying to shred 8 pieces of paper, and eventually broke after about 100 pieces of paper. Purchased a Fellowes instead. First time Amazon Basics has let me down.

   PROS: I want to cover first the high-quality and well-built aspects of this paper shredder. I’ve seen other reviews I personally think the garbage can (bottom portion/ container) is well-built. It had zero problem shipping to me in one piece. I’ve tested and this can easily shred 15 to 16 pieces of normal copy paper and probably 12 of the thicker resume paper. Personally I use this to shred cardboard. (with all the boxes that I get from Amazon and/or for business it’s a great for shredding cardboard) and compost it afterwards. If you see in the video and photo attached the shredder has no problem going through very thick cardboard whatsoever.  Think “A hot knife through butter”. I also want to say that the machine is extremely quiet in comparison to other shredders a have owned or currently own. I’ve seen on other reviews people said it was loud. It obviously isn’t going to be silent. Even in comparison to the Amazon basics 8 sheet shredder, it’s about half as quiet as that. That link is below if you don’t need something this heavy-duty as the 12 sheet.Link to the AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper, CD and Credit Card Home Office Shredder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN9NX0I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BlQDDbTFVANXGCONS: My two issues with this shredder. One the bottom canister or garbage can cannot be replaced because of the safety mechanism that is built into the shredder. I realize it’s put there for safety but it’s kind of a pain if it ever cracks or breaks. Two is the opening only measures about 8.75-9 inches. If a larger amount of paper or cardboard is loaded in and isn't square to the opening it can jam. That’s easily resolved with the reverse button on the top of the shredder. I would link to see this same shredder with a 12 inch opening.Bottoms line is I would buy again or recommend to a friend.If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.

  I have gone through two of these now. The first one seemed decent and I blame myself for overworking it one day.  The second one, however, I barely used and was extremely careful in how many documents I put in at once.  This one died after a few months with no warning. It is plugged into a surge protector with other items that still work so it was not a power fluctuation. It was just dead one day with no power or sign of life at all. I am annoyed because it was clearly a defective unit but I am outside any return window.

  I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!

   This shredder works as advertised. In the attached video you can see it shredding a stack of 15 pages of paper, a CD, and a credit card. All seemed to work without incident. As you can see in the video it creates small cross shredded strips that will make reassembly of the original document more difficult. Stacks of documents will compress into thick strips that require some effort to separate.I would like to see paper bags or something to go in the wastebin as I would like to send the shredded material out to recycling without the having to dump it into another bag later.Currently the device has a bit of an oily / burnt smell but I have a feeling that it's lubricant from the factory. I expect that to dissipate and will report back if it does not. I will also report back on any long term issues I have with it.

  ​I purchased this shredder 3 months ago. Love it!I was looking for something basic for my home office.Pros: - Instead of cutting vertically (""strip-cutting""), this shredder chops the sheets both horizontally and vertically (""cross-cut""). Instead of having some long spaghettis of papers, you get some little pieces of spaghettis, much harder for somebody to infer the original content. - Automatic mode: the shredder starts automatically when you insert a sheet (you can disable this behavior). It will stop on its own if you don't insert anything else. - The security trigger locks the shredder as soon you remove the head from the bin. - It doesn't take much room. - Transparent window to see through to know when to empty the bin. - Not noisy.Cons: Nothing for now.Notes:Avoid plastic envelopes/papers. I tried to shred an envelope made of plastic. Pieces of plastic got stuck inside of the blades. It took me 20 minutes to get it clean. That's when the ""reverse"" feature comes handy.I would recommend this item if you need something basic for daily use. If you want something for multiple people, I would go for something bigger.​

  I shred junk mail like it's a part time job. Seriously, someone must've been trolling my family and I and signed us up for every freakin' mailer available to my area and a few randos for good measure.Still living pre-00's and have wall to wall carpeting everywhere? No problem! Little wheels work on my slightly shaggy carpet no problem. YAY!The unit is quite tall but fits comfortably under my desk and it's not that high, maybe a tad higher than your average banquet table. Bonus: You can sit your lazy bum in your computer chair and not have to bend so far to feed the shredder. I say that's a win any day.Best quality: It's QUIET.

  Over the years I've used a full-size shredder, a micro-shredder, and now this guy. So far, this is the best one.For starters, if you want a continuous-usage shredder you're not going to find it here. If you need to shred for hours and hours spent the cash for a commercial-strength full-size shredder. If, on the other hand, you're occasionally shredding a contract or credit card statement, this will do the trick nicely.I put this shredder through it's paces immediately upon receiving it, because I bought it to shred a large stack of papers I needed to shred to free up some space (tax returns, credit card statements, etc). The device is POWERFUL for it's size. It's blades are small but mighty. Seriously, you can hear this thing rev up like a little jet engine ready to gobble paper up. You CAN overload it with continuous 6-sheet shreds (it's a bad idea to shred a lot of multi-paper jobs at the max thickness a shredder is rated for), but if you let it breath a little between jobs and only feed it a few pages at a time, it handles it nicely.I expected the device to jam after shredding this huge stack of papers and it did, but I was able to clear it without too much trouble (I wish the opening was a little wider so I could easily pull out stuck paper with needle-nose pliers, but that's the only flaw in the device I found). A few minutes of reverse, forward, reverse, and a few yanks with the pliers and the one jam cleared without further issue.The real nice thing is that this device seems to handle paperclips just fine, and has a nice size waste bin for a product in this low price range.Well, there you have it. I was expected a piece of junk in this price range for very small jobs, and was overjoyed to find this device a step up. It has plenty of power, and shreds beautifully. Just don't try to run it for an hour shredding construction paper, folders, and 6 pages at once. Feed it a few pages at a time or one thick piece at a time and let it cool down every few minutes, and it should last you a good long time. Or at least longer than my last mini-shredder did. That thing is toast.

  I purchased this bad boy for my wife’s home office. Let me start off by saying this thing shreds harder than Andy Brinker from the 1998 classic film Brink. For those of you who don’t know, this 99 min film introduced some of the most unique roller blade shredding ever witnessed. Purchase this and you can be shredding like Andy in no time!Update** after using the the shredder my wife has been walking around the house being very confrontational. She now says things like “Bruh, do you even shred!?” For this reason I have to deduct one star.

  This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,

   PROS: I want to cover first the high-quality and well-built aspects of this paper shredder. I’ve seen other reviews I personally think the garbage can (bottom portion/ container) is well-built. It had zero problem shipping to me in one piece. I’ve tested and this can easily shred 15 to 16 pieces of normal copy paper and probably 12 of the thicker resume paper. Personally I use this to shred cardboard. (with all the boxes that I get from Amazon and/or for business it’s a great for shredding cardboard) and compost it afterwards. If you see in the video and photo attached the shredder has no problem going through very thick cardboard whatsoever.  Think “A hot knife through butter”. I also want to say that the machine is extremely quiet in comparison to other shredders a have owned or currently own. I’ve seen on other reviews people said it was loud. It obviously isn’t going to be silent. Even in comparison to the Amazon basics 8 sheet shredder, it’s about half as quiet as that. That link is below if you don’t need something this heavy-duty as the 12 sheet.Link to the AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper, CD and Credit Card Home Office Shredder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DN9NX0I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BlQDDbTFVANXGCONS: My two issues with this shredder. One the bottom canister or garbage can cannot be replaced because of the safety mechanism that is built into the shredder. I realize it’s put there for safety but it’s kind of a pain if it ever cracks or breaks. Two is the opening only measures about 8.75-9 inches. If a larger amount of paper or cardboard is loaded in and isn't square to the opening it can jam. That’s easily resolved with the reverse button on the top of the shredder. I would link to see this same shredder with a 12 inch opening.Bottoms line is I would buy again or recommend to a friend.If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.

  Returned after three days. It had the worst time trying to shred 8 pieces of paper, and eventually broke after about 100 pieces of paper. Purchased a Fellowes instead. First time Amazon Basics has let me down.

  I purchased this bad boy for my wife’s home office. Let me start off by saying this thing shreds harder than Andy Brinker from the 1998 classic film Brink. For those of you who don’t know, this 99 min film introduced some of the most unique roller blade shredding ever witnessed. Purchase this and you can be shredding like Andy in no time!Update** after using the the shredder my wife has been walking around the house being very confrontational. She now says things like “Bruh, do you even shred!?” For this reason I have to deduct one star.

  I have gone through two of these now. The first one seemed decent and I blame myself for overworking it one day.  The second one, however, I barely used and was extremely careful in how many documents I put in at once.  This one died after a few months with no warning. It is plugged into a surge protector with other items that still work so it was not a power fluctuation. It was just dead one day with no power or sign of life at all. I am annoyed because it was clearly a defective unit but I am outside any return window.

  I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!

   This shredder works as advertised. In the attached video you can see it shredding a stack of 15 pages of paper, a CD, and a credit card. All seemed to work without incident. As you can see in the video it creates small cross shredded strips that will make reassembly of the original document more difficult. Stacks of documents will compress into thick strips that require some effort to separate.I would like to see paper bags or something to go in the wastebin as I would like to send the shredded material out to recycling without the having to dump it into another bag later.Currently the device has a bit of an oily / burnt smell but I have a feeling that it's lubricant from the factory. I expect that to dissipate and will report back if it does not. I will also report back on any long term issues I have with it.

  Over the years I've used a full-size shredder, a micro-shredder, and now this guy. So far, this is the best one.For starters, if you want a continuous-usage shredder you're not going to find it here. If you need to shred for hours and hours spent the cash for a commercial-strength full-size shredder. If, on the other hand, you're occasionally shredding a contract or credit card statement, this will do the trick nicely.I put this shredder through it's paces immediately upon receiving it, because I bought it to shred a large stack of papers I needed to shred to free up some space (tax returns, credit card statements, etc). The device is POWERFUL for it's size. It's blades are small but mighty. Seriously, you can hear this thing rev up like a little jet engine ready to gobble paper up. You CAN overload it with continuous 6-sheet shreds (it's a bad idea to shred a lot of multi-paper jobs at the max thickness a shredder is rated for), but if you let it breath a little between jobs and only feed it a few pages at a time, it handles it nicely.I expected the device to jam after shredding this huge stack of papers and it did, but I was able to clear it without too much trouble (I wish the opening was a little wider so I could easily pull out stuck paper with needle-nose pliers, but that's the only flaw in the device I found). A few minutes of reverse, forward, reverse, and a few yanks with the pliers and the one jam cleared without further issue.The real nice thing is that this device seems to handle paperclips just fine, and has a nice size waste bin for a product in this low price range.Well, there you have it. I was expected a piece of junk in this price range for very small jobs, and was overjoyed to find this device a step up. It has plenty of power, and shreds beautifully. Just don't try to run it for an hour shredding construction paper, folders, and 6 pages at once. Feed it a few pages at a time or one thick piece at a time and let it cool down every few minutes, and it should last you a good long time. Or at least longer than my last mini-shredder did. That thing is toast.

  ​I purchased this shredder 3 months ago. Love it!I was looking for something basic for my home office.Pros: - Instead of cutting vertically (""strip-cutting""), this shredder chops the sheets both horizontally and vertically (""cross-cut""). Instead of having some long spaghettis of papers, you get some little pieces of spaghettis, much harder for somebody to infer the original content. - Automatic mode: the shredder starts automatically when you insert a sheet (you can disable this behavior). It will stop on its own if you don't insert anything else. - The security trigger locks the shredder as soon you remove the head from the bin. - It doesn't take much room. - Transparent window to see through to know when to empty the bin. - Not noisy.Cons: Nothing for now.Notes:Avoid plastic envelopes/papers. I tried to shred an envelope made of plastic. Pieces of plastic got stuck inside of the blades. It took me 20 minutes to get it clean. That's when the ""reverse"" feature comes handy.I would recommend this item if you need something basic for daily use. If you want something for multiple people, I would go for something bigger.​

  I shred junk mail like it's a part time job. Seriously, someone must've been trolling my family and I and signed us up for every freakin' mailer available to my area and a few randos for good measure.Still living pre-00's and have wall to wall carpeting everywhere? No problem! Little wheels work on my slightly shaggy carpet no problem. YAY!The unit is quite tall but fits comfortably under my desk and it's not that high, maybe a tad higher than your average banquet table. Bonus: You can sit your lazy bum in your computer chair and not have to bend so far to feed the shredder. I say that's a win any day.Best quality: It's QUIET. Didn't realize how loud and rumbly my 3-ish year-old Walmart special was until I plugged in this guy. Super happy about that! No longer scaring my poor hamster with the shredder from hell.All in all so far it's a great product!

  This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,
