1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I decided I wanted to get a paper shredder, just to shred the junk mail I’ve been getting lately. I saw this, and the price was enticing and I figured 8-sheet was more than enough for the 3 or 4 letters I get a day. So after going through my mail, opening them up and all, I started shred them one by one. I got to the third letter when I started to smell like something was burning. So I stopped, and unplugged it. I was a little surprised by what happened, and decided I’ll deal with this later when I get home from work. Once I got home, I plugged it back in and stuck the last letter in. The burning smell came back almost immediately, and I saw smoke coming up from where I put in the letter. I immediately unplugged it, with the letter still visible in the slot.I contacted Amazon customer service, which the offered to send a replacement but I’m to wary about getting another one of the same model. Maybe I’ll invest in one that’s a little more powerful, perhaps 8-sheet wasn’t enough for junk mail. I want to make it clear, it’s not like I was shoving thick unopened letters in the shredder. I opened the letters, took out the contents, reviewed them, and then shredded the contents which a max is three pages. If I was shoving unopened letters, I would have put partial blame on myself. However, that’s not the case.I would maybe invest in one slightly stronger model, because 8-sheet just didn’t cut it for 3-sheets."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty thrilled with this shredder right now !  I was suspicious at first and considered sending it back because it had shreds in the bottom of the drawer already like someone had used it and sent it back. Instead, I opted to try it first.  I had a completely full 15 gallon garbage bag of financial documents  in the corner of my bedroom that I had been unable to shred with my old super slow shredder that would shut down after 2-3 minutes of use. So, I commenced shredding, and shred, and shred and shred, nonstop, until the entire bag was finished ! This shredder is definitely KING of shredders, IMO, for the price ! VERY happy !"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now been through 3 of these shredders. Each one failed for the same reason: the reverse function was inoperative, both auto and manual. This third machine basically failed right out of the box! I was shredding only 12 sheets at a time. After 15 minutes the ""overload"" light came on, but the machine failed to auto-reverse. The manual reverse also failed to work, so there it was, with 12 sheets half in the slot and half still sticking out. Without the reverse function it is impossible to remove the unshredded sheets as they are firmly ""locked"" in the shredding teeth.This unit is rated for 24 sheets of 20 lb paper at a time, 40 minutes run time before 50 minutes ""rest.""  It could not handly even 12 sheets at a time for 15 minutes.I'm returning this for credit, as I have no faith that a 4th unit will work any better. As this is an ""Amazon Basics"" item, Amazon should have direct access to the manufacturers and should inform them that they can no longer carry this product.Kudos to Amazon's generous return policy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: After over a year, the shredder is still working great. I use this in my kitchen to shred junk mail or anything with my address. It will zip through a typical 3 to 4 page credit card solicitation in seconds. A few staples are no problem either. If you put more than 6 pages, the motor bogs down but will slowly chew through it- I've done that a few times where it just stopped. There is a reverse switch to unclog it if you get overzealous in your shredding. It is usually faster to just put 3 pages in at a time. It has a credit card slot and has no problem chopping them up. There is a safety switch on the back that only allows the shredder to work while in the supplied can (this prevents chopped fingers if you don't unplug it while cleaning the teeth out; BUT if you want to shred into a bigger container, you aren't able to.)Great deal on a cross-cut general purpose shredder. In this day and age, there is no excuse for not making sure your personal information is secure. No paper/junk mail/etc goes in my trash without going through this shredder first."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"SAYS it's made for home office,  I guess because if it was a commercial office it would cost to much labor to operate it.  SORRY BUT apparently Amazon basics means CHEAP JUNK.  The shredder  has a deep intake slot probably for safety. If it struggles, it reverses and jams the intake slot WHICH IS almost impossible to clear.  It says 12  sheets, I say caution at 10.  Not sure this one will survive the home office.  OK, my fault for ordering on line from Amazon.  This is the first thing I purchased that was branded Amazon, yes made in China... GRRRR  their return policy sucks or I would trade it for better.  If I return it for exchange I get the same junk again.  The freight for return for credit would eat up the price, its heavy.  DO NOT BUY."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quiet machine with ample capacity both in number of sheet at a time and duty time.  The bin for chads is more than adequate for large shredding parties.  The machine is heavy (it should be) and very stable.  I would buy this again and again.  BTW it does a goos job of shredding old CD's, ( I had some old tax records on them.) But, who has CD's anymore? If you are wondering, the chads are small enough for security purposes.  Besides once you shred 10 sheets everything is so commingled no one is stealing your info.Update: I’ve shredded at least 10 bankers boxes of old taxes, military records, estate papers, etc.  I ate them all including numerous CD’s with files and a few credit cards.  The chads are small so no one will be able to read anything off of them.  I like the size of the bin, in daily household use you shouldn’t have to empty it but once a month.  I think the product would be great for 5 or 6 person office too."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed. Received shredder and plugged it in.Completely defective. Never turned on.Called service department said it was defective. Has to be returned for service.Went to staples and bought a different brand.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shredder is listed as a light/medium duty but I used it to shred a lot when I first used it. So far it has done a great job shredding. I've run two box loads of old documents (8 1/2"" x 11"" sheets of paper piled about 18"" high) thru the shredder. Enough to fill five 13 gallon trash bags of firmly compacted shreds. I never ran the eight max sheets but kept it to five of less. With thicker sheets, I just ran a single sheet thru. I also tried to avoid running staples thru even though it's OK to do so. The machine never jammed or overheated and turned itself off. I never ran it more than 3 minutes at a time anyways and would use it sporadically to not overheat it. The feed slot is at an angle but you get used to it quickly. The sensor is electronic, not a flimsy plastic tab sticking out triggered by a sheet of paper. To keep it oiled I just poured some mineral oil on a sheet of paper and ran it thru the cutters.The switch has a lot of side to side play but it does the job. It does have a decent click when seated in one of three positions. Auto, Off, or Reverse. The 4.1 gallon bin is a little soft and flimsy so handle it carefully. The window is nice to see how full the bin is getting. A little gentle shaking helps settle the shreds down as you go. The thinner the paper the better job it does crosscutting. Still it shreds enough for home use. The handle makes emptying the bin a lot easier."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Will only give it 3 stars, since it arrived broken. The reason for breakage was that the little plastic  tab attached to the door and which activates the shredder had broken off. The shredder will not work without it and gives a message that the door is not closed, even when it is. For such an important function, they could have made this small plastic piece sturdier than it is.. Amazon replaced the shredder and the actual functioning of the machine is fine, but I am mindful of this thin plastic tab when I open and close the door. I also want to note that the shredder is heavy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I shred junk mail like it's a part time job. Seriously, someone must've been trolling my family and I and signed us up for every freakin' mailer available to my area and a few randos for good measure.Still living pre-00's and have wall to wall carpeting everywhere? No problem! Little wheels work on my slightly shaggy carpet no problem. YAY!The unit is quite tall but fits comfortably under my desk and it's not that high, maybe a tad higher than your average banquet table. Bonus: You can sit your lazy bum in your computer chair and not have to bend so far to feed the shredder. I say that's a win any day.Best quality: It's QUIET. Didn't realize how loud and rumbly my 3-ish year-old Walmart special was until I plugged in this guy. Super happy about that! No longer scaring my poor hamster with the shredder from hell.All in all so far it's a great product!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been looking for a shredder for a while now since, while fun, burning documents isn't the most practical thing in the world. Luckily, I got this on sale.I was a little apprehensive after seeing reviews of it not working properly, but I wanted to give it a shot. So far, it's been working wonderfully. Even though it's listed as 8 sheets, I don't do more than 4-5 to play safe. It did start to show signs of overheating (I was getting rid of a LOT like old bank statements and theatre scripts i have no use for), so I let it cool down like the instructions stated.The main cons is that it did have chunks stuck after big passes, but I think that was because I was a little careless. And it's easy to clear out. It's also on the small side so you're going to empty it pretty frequently. But that's not a big issue.Overall, I recommend it.Update: A few months later and she's still working marvelously. One recommendation- don't insert big chunky spam mail as it doesn't destroy it entirely."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a shredder for several years that worked great; it was made by Fellowe's. When Amazon offered me a new model under the Amazon Vine Program, I jumped at it, since my old one was getting on and was several years old.  I figured it couldn't last too much longer.  I had the new one about three months, until the time came to empty the basket for the first time. After I did, it jammed and would not work.  So I adjusted my Vine Review accordingly and ordered this one.  It arrived today.I took it out of the box and read the User Manual thoroughly.  Then I plugged it in and switched it on.  I had several pieces of paper to shred, since I had been without a shredder for almost a week.I fed in the first sheet of paper.  I could hear it shred, but the paper did not advance into the shredder.  I pulled the paper out and noted that the edge of the paper - barely one quarter inch - had been shredded.  I turned the paper around and tried feeding it from the other end, with the same results.So, I pulled out another sheet of paper that needed to be shredded and tried that.  Same thing - the shredder shredded the edge of the paper, but the paper would not advance further into the machine.  I put the shredder back in the box it came in and notified Amazon that I want a refund.When I had opened the box to unpack the latest machine, there was a note from Amazon that said that ""each shredder is tested before it is shipped, so you may notice some paper scraps in the baske""t.  Well, if they'd tested the machine I got, they never would have shipped it.  Because it doesn't work.I wonder if Amazon gets tired of paying the postage on returns for defective products, the same way I get tired of packing them up and shipping them back?  Because this is - believe it or not - the third item I have had to return to Amazon this week.Please fellas - stop sending out defective merchandise!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewing the 12-sheet Amazon Basics paper shredder. In picture: small Aurora 4-sheet shredder (AS420C) and 7-gallon (15-inch-tall) recycling bin included for size reference. Black 12-sheet shredder is in the middle. This thing eats cardboard easily. Great shredder. Not too tall, not too small. The capacity is generous. A little bit too much for my needs, but I highly recommend it for anyone who has big piles of paper needing to be shredded. It's a little loud but not too bad, but it is super heavy. (But not necessarily heavier than the average 12-sheet shredder I assume, so don't let that steer you away) I'm going to stick with the 4-sheet Aurora shredder because even though it can't handle the thick Amazon-box cardboard like this 12-sheet shredder can, it's at least strong enough to cut through thin-style cardboard."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased several different items under the ""Amazon Basics"" branding,and have been impressed by the quality of the items for what you pay for them. This shredder is no different. Great quality at a very economical price! The shredder is listed as a 12 sheet, but I kept my paper feed to 8 sheets or less as most bank and credit card statements are in that range.The instructions state that you should give the shredder a 30 minute break after about 7 minutes of continuous run, but this little shredder kept going and going!I filled the 4 gallon bin over a dozen times in less than 3 hours (I was WAY behind on my shredding duties!), and this little workhorse did not overheat or jam once.FIVE STARS for this wonderful shredder!PROS:* Great price for a 12 sheet crosscut shredder* Very simple to use - sliding switch for OFF, FORWARD (continuous), REVERSE (continuous), and AUTO (runs as fed paper)* Indicator lights to show if shredder is on (green), full, misaligned, or overheated (red)* Auto shutoff if overheating to protect motor.* Quiet operationCONS:None that I can speak of!RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USERS:* Be kind to your shredder! If you are shredding heavy, stop at half basket intervals (or when you hear the shredder slowing down), unplug the shredder, lift the head off the basket, and clear the shredded paper. It keeps the shredder working at optimal speed.* I highly recommend that you also purchase the 'Amazon' branded 'lubricating / sharpening sheets'.. They are easy to use (just shred one after every 30 minutes of service, and then activate the 'reverse' function for 10 seconds). This will keep you shredder's blades sharp and lubricated and protect your investment.SUMMARY:I highly recommend this shredder. Amazon also offers a 6 or 8 sheet shredder, but I think the 12 sheet model is worth the extra $10-$15, especially if you are shredding stuff like credit card offers without even opening the envelope. I'm not sure that the 6 or 8 sheet models would handle that task as quickly, and when it comes to shredding, I just want to get it done without delays or jams.For anyone considering this shredder, I hope this information has been helpful! Peace."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally ordered this product and received it January 26, 2018. I used it maybe five times, each time shredding no more than 2 pages at a time (even though it claims to be an 8-sheet shredder) over an extended period of time. The unit stopped working without cause on Feb. 13, 2018.I received a free replacement on Feb. 17, 2018, as it was within the 30 day warranty period. However, the replacement item was barely used between March and April and on April 27, 2018, it stopped working (same as the original unit).Given both the original unit and the replacement performed poorly and came no where near meeting my expectations, I do not recommend this product. If you're going to spend over $30 on a shredder, get something reliable that you won't have to replace every month!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as much as one can like a shredder. It works as advertised and was priced competitively. The one part of the machine I do not care too much for is the switch...as I tend to like to leave electric devices in the off position, I need to keep pushing the switch to off or on...a minor inconvenience, but an on/off switch would make this a better product. The switch now has all of the modes of operation in a row."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not someone who uses a paper shredder every day, but when I do, I really use it hard.  This shredder was a surprisingly good value and quieter than I expected.  That said, my last one overheated and needed to be replaced.  This shredder has a 3 minute constant run time and a nice overheat indicator light that should help prevent me from making the same mistake.Another thing I want to comment on:  I am always paranoid about buying anything electrical online.  I fear it won't work properly and returning it will be a hassle.  If your like me, you'll be happy to know Amazon leaves a little note inside the package that they test the paper shredder before shipping it to you!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When something says it will shred credit cards, I expect it to do as it claims.  It didn't.  Now it won't work.  I was going to return it, but the shipping alone is more expensive than what I paid for the shredder.  No thank you.  As far as the rating,  the shredder itself is sturdy, but I WILL NOT SHRED CREDIT CARDS.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  In this day and time, that is one of the most important things to shred."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got it earlier this week, but I had gathered bags and bags of old paperwork that needs to be shredded and there is no public drop-off point for me in these times.  I went for a 24 page shredder as a compromise between quality and price.  This unit more than meets my needs and although in one sitting I will not be able to shred everything, this will work just fine if you have lots to shred.On the page limit, I only got the overload once and I was amazed because the shredder attempted to auto-correct itself by throwing it in reverse and then forward into the jam was cleared.  And it did clear the jam itself without any manual intervention.  I can't say that I counted the number of pages I fed it at a time, but I was feeding it fistfuls of paper and like I say just one jam.Also, I shredded receipts, prescription sheets and all kinds of other irregular paper without problems.  I inserted either vertically or horizontally and it worked either way.The bin size is just fine for me.  I felt I got a good amount of shredding in before I had to empty it.The one wish-list item that I would want which does not affect the rating is that there is no oil-sheet to lubricate the shredder and I hear these can be expensive.  So make sure you find other ways, but I am not there yet."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good value for this Amazon Basic cross cutter.  States 12 sheets of 20-lb bond paper tho that's chancing everyone knows the limits of that.  I've tried that but it's pushing it a bit considering you have 7-min max limit to then allow a cool down period of 30-min.  Granted most aren't going to be purging years, if so this isn't the right model.  Periodic as mail comes in or a weekly shredding is plenty good and make sure to get proper lubricant to keep it running sharp.  I'm a but lazy as I buy the prepped sheets with lubricant and sharpening properties.  I'd had liked outside bucket handles to carry both the shredder and bucket, but you can't have it all on a value model, tho having what's important is provided.  Read the instructions thoroughly before using is the best advice given.  I'm a fan and user of this product.  Thank you for reading."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this immediately after returning Amazon's more basic version because I was afraid the documents weren't being destroyed enough. This unit certainly met me expectations for that. See photo for average shredded profile. Unfortunately the 'Auto' featured failed within a few weeks. And finally 3 years later the until will no longer operate. Light use, usually only 1-3 sheets at a time. Maybe once a month. My other complaint would be that the credit card slot is completely the wrong direction as it allowed the entire card number to but output when shredded given the direction and shredded profile. Works great for most documents and credit/debit cards if turned 90 degrees to separate all numbers."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I""m so glad I got this paper shredder.  I'd had a shredder some years ago that was such a dud that I had a hard time imagining one working well for such a reasonable price.  It's swift, efficient, and effective, and unlike the machines I shopped in Staples, it feels very solid.  Now I can dispatch in seconds those papers that need to be destroyed."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this bad boy for my wife’s home office. Let me start off by saying this thing shreds harder than Andy Brinker from the 1998 classic film Brink. For those of you who don’t know, this 99 min film introduced some of the most unique roller blade shredding ever witnessed. Purchase this and you can be shredding like Andy in no time!Update** after using the the shredder my wife has been walking around the house being very confrontational. She now says things like “Bruh, do you even shred!?” For this reason I have to deduct one star."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The only issue here is the sensor for the hopper keeps saying it is full. You have to jiggle it around to get the sensor to realize that the hopper is empty. I attempted to get warranty service. They responded that I had to correct my email address since it was purchased on a different email account. I did do this and responded to them that it was under my account. To date, now 3 weeks since I responded to them, I have heard no word. Good price. HORRIBLE customer service. The thing is worthless because the sensor thinks it is full all the time so I cannot use it. I haven't shredded anything for over 2 months now.They finally got back to me and refunded the money that I spent on this. I have purchased another brand."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrid. Horrid. Horrid. Do not waste your money or time. You will only have to  return it. The credit card slot stopped working. The shredder only works on one side. You can’t get an entire sheet of paper through.Stephanie and Danny from Customer Service’s Tech Support for the shredder are terrible to deal with. They interrupt and it took all of my strength not to sound like a sailor. They made me VERY stressed.The product is horrid and why you would want your customers to have a bad experience is beyond me.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a quite nice machine. Very basic yet built tough to do the job. The first job I had for this shredder was a ten inches pile of documents and several closed documents, some quite thick ones. I even had my kids help me with it, for the very thick ones I opened as I was afraid of jamming the machine. The machine performed quite well which generated 9 full buckets of shredded paper. Many of the documents where stapled at the top corner and the shredder chewed right through it without any issues. I did get the machine jammed with a set of 9 sheets so I was a bit surprised as the maximum recommended is 12. They were packed very tight so that is why I think it jammed the machine.THE GOOD STUFF:Heavy duty feel to the build of the machineBasic features to get the job done - Auto On with a sensor, reverse to remove jams, safety button which only allows the teeth to rotate when the top is fully attached to the bucket (great feature as the teeth are EXTREMELY sharp which is a good thingCompact Size and discreetTHE NOT SO GREAT STUFF:It produces a lot more dust than our previous unitIts a bit noisy, so if you are using in an office its best to put it on an more isolated area than in your deskThe shredded material is quite wide and long (about ¼ inch by 1 and ¼). It would be nice if they were chopped once more to less than half an inchTHE BAD STUFFTHought the unit with the motor is well built, the bucket is quite flimsy and due to the safety mechanism it will be hard to retrofit it to another bucket without bypassing the safety click (and that would be dangerous as the unit could turn on while upside down and that would be VERY VERY dangerous.Overall I would definitely recommend this simple shredder for the home office use. If there is lot of demand and several people on constant of use like in an small office, this might be OK but it would be on the edge. I used for 30 minutes basically only stopping to dump out the material and it got a bit worm but delivered only with a small jam. Please let me know if this helps you or if you need any additional pics or other info. Cheers,"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace one from a big box office supply store that failed after about 5 years.  This one is essentially exactly the same as my other one - same cross-cut, same footprint, same features, about the same price.  It does have one better design feature, the fact that the little handhold in the front, the hand-sized opening in the trashcan part allows you to easily see when it is filling up.  The ONLY reason I took one star off is because of what I'm assuming is a safety feature, which I just find annoying:  In my previous model, you could walk up to the shredder and just feed the paper right in, nothing special, in it went.  On this one, there is not a direct, vertical feed option - the feed area has a ""cover"" of sorts built into it that requires you to feed the paper in practically horizontal to the unit.  I'm absolutely certain this is on purpose, to prevent small fingers and such from getting dragged in.  But I find it a bit annoying."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I give this shredder three and a half stars.  I think it's solid overall and should last a long time.  The build quality seems good, and I don't notice any weakness in this area.  The noise level is ""ok.""  It's definitely quieter than the 10-year old Fellowes shredder it replaced, but I don't find the new sound level to be anything groundbreaking.  I haven't had the troubles of closing the bin like others have.  I keep a trash bag in it, and every once in awhile it won't close all the way.  I just give it a tap or adjust the bag, and it's fine.  The one annoyance I have that bothers me is the size or angle of the opening for the paper to shred.  I find the opening to be too narrow for my liking, and if I have any more than approximately five papers, I find it difficult to insert them.  The opening itself is at a slight angle, as well, so I have to try to angle the papers in, or I have to make sure each paper in the stack is straightened really well.  Even a single receipt can be slightly frustrating at times.  With my Fellowes, the opening was easily accessible, straight up and down at the top.  I found that design to be easier and more user friendly.  The other half star I took off was because there are deals on other shredders that are micro-cut where this one isn't.  This does shred small, so it's not a complete deal breaker.  The bottom line I ask myself is:  Would I buy it again?  And in this case, no, I don't think I would.  It does work well, and it will get the job done, so if it's at a great price compared to others and you don't use it that much, sure go for it.  But the next time I personally shop for one, I will look for one that is easier to feed, that's micro cut, and one that is even quieter if possible.  Best of luck."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not recommend purchasing this shredder. I just purchased the shredder less than three weeks ago and after shredding less than 30 pieces of paper it has completely shut down and is non-functional. I was very excited to use the shredder for at least six months to year. The worst part is that I've attempted to return the shredder to Amazon for a replacement considering this may just be a lemon shredder. Amazon is stating that is outside the window for return which is shocking considering it is less than 2 to 3 weeks since I received it. Amazon usually is very good about returning or replacing dysfunctional faulty products. In this case scenario I have lost $40 for a useless product that I can't even return despite having had it for just less than three weeks. I usually expect way more than this from from an ""Amazon basic product"" which came with extremely high reviews from Amazon.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHREDDER."
