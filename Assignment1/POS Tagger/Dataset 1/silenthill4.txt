Upon awaking, examine everything in your bedroom, you can examine something 
when the eyeball icon appears.  Enter your living room and kitchen next.  
Examine everything that you can and try to return to your bedroom.  This 
should trigger a scene.  After the opening credits you will awaken in your 
room once again.  Feel free to look out the window to see what is going on.  
Leave your bedroom and approach your front door.  Go back into your living 
room and note a scrap of paper sticking out from behind the bookcase, next to 
the television.  After reading it, check the opposite corner to find a red 
book on the table.  You can use this to save your game whenever you wish.  
Approach the door again, pass by the large chest sitting against the wall and 
it will automatically bring you to a little men.  You can use this to store as 
many items as you want, since you can only hold ten things at once.  Look 
under your front door to find a scrap of paper.  After reading it, go into the 
room beside the front door and check everything out.  In your kitchen, open 
the fridge door and take the -Wine Bottle- as well as the -Chocolate Milk-.  
Now it's time to check out that loud noise that came from the bathroom.  Go 
there and watch the scene.  When you're ready examine the hole to get the
-Steel Pipe- then enter the hole.  Hold up to reach the Subway World.

Equip your Steel Pipe (using the square button) when you reach the bottom of 
the escalator.  Head West (assording to your map which you can look at by 
pressing triangle) to trigger a scene with a mysterious woman.  Now she'll be 
following you around, as you go around the corner past the washrooms another 
scene occurs.  Now it's time to take on your first enemies.  Hold R2 to get 
into the fighting pose.  Remember these creatures will attack violently if you 
try to turn your back and run, but they will hesitate if you stay facing them.  
Hold X to charge up your attack then get close and let loose.  Keep your 
distance while charging.  Once the enemies are defeated, make absolutely sure 
by approaching the bodies and pressing X to stomp on them.  They won't be 
getting up after that.  Enter the washroom to find another hole, go into the 
hole which takes you back to the bedroom at your apartment again.

Leave the bedroom and return to the living room.  Notice your health is 
gradually returning to full while here, be sure to keep this in mind, that you 
can return to your apartment and heal rather than wasting items all the time.  
Check the small shelf in the corner of your living room near the kitchen to 
see that it has moved, choose to straighten it.  You will find a -Pistol- on 
the ground.  Examine the writing on the wall.  After reading it, examine the 
hole in the wall.  After doing so you'll hear the sound of a phone ringing.  
It's coming from your room, go back and answer it.  When you leave the room 
another sound is heard.  This time head to your front door and look out the 
peephole.  That's brings an end to everything you need to do here, it's time 
to visit the world of the hole again.  Return to your bathroom and climb in.

When you reach the washroom again, examine the bloody mannequin to get the 
-Lynch Street Line Coin-.  Leave the washroom and make a left.  In the next 
area you will find a couple of turnstiles and a dog wandering around.  Kill 
the dog by cramming your Steel Pipe down its throat then continue across, past 
the turnstiles, to the next area.  Here are two of those evil dog monsters as 
well as an enormous worm-like body of which you can only see a piece of.  
Don't worry about this worm, while creepy, it can neither attack you nor be 
killed.  It does however react to your attacks, so feel free to whack it for 
fun.  Be sure to eliminate the enemies before messing around however.  Go 
around behind the worm down the hall to the West to find -Pistol Bullets-.  
That's all there is to get here, return to the turnstiles.  There are four 
turnstiles here but only one of them will change to a stationary camera view 
when you stand in front of it.  This one has a little token box on the left.  
Face the actual turnstile, not the toekn box and press square to bring up the 
little inventory menu.  Use the D-pad to cycle right to the coin and press 
square to use the Lynch Street Line Coin to open up the turnstile.

At the bottom of the stairs there's a quick cutscene and a new type of enemy 
appears.  These are the ghost enemies, they have the ability to harm you even 
without attacking, simply being in their vicinity will damage you and they are 
cannot be killed so unlike the dogs, the best thing to do is to just run.  At 
the bottom of the stairs make a right (when facing down the stairs) and keep 
going down.  At the bottom you will hear a voice, use the right analog stick 
to look over and see Cynthia trapped in one of the subway cars.  Run all the 
way to the end of the waiting platform and go into the final door on the 
subway at the top (South end.)  There is a red button beside you, press the 
button and leave this subway car.  Return to the train car where you saw 
Cynthia trapped previously, she has already been let out and will quickly 
rejoin you, but you still want to go through that door.  Go through the door 
on the right then head up, and go through the door on the left.  There is a 
box in this train car, feel free to examine it but you cannot do anything with 
it at the moment.  Go up through the door, and up through the next door.  In 
this car make a right to get out of the subway car and go up, there should be 
two doors here.  Head throguh the door on the right, then go down and throguh 
the door at the bottom.  There's a door on your left here, go down, through 
the door on the right and down again.  This is the last area you have to go 
through, just go down as much as you can, then right to escape.

You are finally out of the subway cars now, just South of you are some stairs 
leading up, at the top pick up the -Pistol Bullets-.  Descend the stairs again 
and run all the way to the South end, the door here is open.  You will find a 
hole on the other side.  At this point, in terms of progressing the game there 
is no reason to go htorugh the hole, however, in terms of healing yourself and 
using your storage box back at the apartment there may be a good reason to use 
it.  Since there are no negative consequences at all to going back and 
healing, you might as well do it.  When you return to the Subway World through 
the hole again you will pop right back out in this room.  Climb down the 
ladder to the bottom and take a few steps to reach a fork in the path.  Don't 
go across the wooden boards to the South, instead climb the ladder to the 
West.  You will find -Pistol Bullets- at the top of the ladder.  Examine the 
door and you will unlock it.  That's all you need to do, climb back down the 
ladder and go South at the fork, across those boards.  It's a pretty linear 
path to the door at the end.  Kill the dog monster when you come out of the 
door.  There are quite a few of these in this area, if you move gradually you 
should be able to take them on one at a time rather than four at once.  When 
you see the open door of a subway car, go isnide and run to the end.  There is 
a golf club on the seat, pick up the -9-Iron-.  The goldclub is much strong 
than the Steel Pipe however like the description says, if you keep using it, 
it will break and there's no way to prevent this, so it's just kind of a 
temporary weapon.  Leave the subway car and keep going West until you see an 
escalator.  Grab the -Nutrition Drink- at the bottom and ride the escalator 
up.  If you ignore the escalator and keep going West you will find another 
hole.  The next thing you have to do is kind of dangerous, I would seriously 
recommend returning and restoring your health first.  Also if you have a full 
inventory, be sure to drop off some items in your chest like the Lynch Street 
Line Coin, some of those many Pistol Bullets, perhaps the Wine Bottle.  Return 
to the Subway World and go East then head up the escalator

This is kind of difficult, the escalator is very long and creatures will 
appear of of the walls to attack you.  There are a few tactics you can use to 
avoid damage.  Personally I prefer to run and just try to time the movements 
between attacks.  You can whip out the Steel Pipe to either stun or even kill 
the things in the walls, perhaps you will find it easiest to use the Pistol.  
Either way, you'll eventually reach the top.  Run East down to the end of the 
hall and grab the -Pistol Bullets- then climb the stairs to the top.  After 
examining the objects on the ground, examine the door to get the 
-Temptation Placard-.  Open the door and watch the cutscene to be warped back.

Take a look out your window upon waking here.  Something odd is going on 
outside.  Leave your bedroom and listen to the radio transmission that chimes 
in.  Once it ends, take a look under your door for a scrap of paper.  After 
reading it you've done pretty much everything there is to do (besides take 
another peek on Eileen, you can do that whenever you want.)  Head for the 
bathroom and get ready to enter the hole once again.  Before you go check your 
inventory.  You can drop off most of the irrelevant items, in fact the only 
two things you absolutely need are the Chocolate Milk and Steel Pipe.

Move West and go through the gate.  Down this path you will find a large set 
of metal double doors and a hole to get back to your apartment beside them.  
In this room there are some flying creatures buzzing around.  The Steel Pipe 
will make short work of these enemies, no need to even chage it up, in fact it 
works better if you just swing quickly and wildly.  Grab the -Pistol Buttlets- 
from the bottom of the ramp and go into the next room where you'll find more 
of those obnoxious buzzing things.  Proceed through the gate and examine the 
car that is running, the driver's side door is open and there is a note in it.  
Examine it again to find a second memo.  Before leaving, if you've beaten the 
game prior to this, you'll find the -Chainsaw- in this area.  Now go down the 
path and through the gate to find a man sitting on the rock.  Listen to what 
he has to say then notice there is a kind of a fence thing in the middle with 
candles on it.  Well in one corner, on the opposite side of the fence from 
Jasper you'll find a -Nutrition Drink- laying on the ground.  Now porceed 
through the gate at the Southwest corner and be ready with your pipe.

Defeat the three dog monsters in this areea and be careful of the sort of 
fenced in area in the middle, a large object will drop though I'm fairly sure 
it can't actually hurt you.  In the next area there are three more of them as 
well, once again, use your pipe to club their faces and keep going.  Once you 
reach the large open area, enter the hole on the right side at the start.

Leave the bedroom and go answer the buzz at the front door.  There will be a 
scene when you look out of your peephole.  If you've saved your game, healed 
up and stuck the Chocolate Milk in your inventory, then it's time to go back.

There is more than one door here, the one you want is the upper left 
(Northwest) door when looking at your map.  Run through this area and the next 
area to reach a place that overlooks the lake.  There is a -Portable Medical
Kit- on the ground here beside you.  There's also a hole here to get back to 
your apartment but since you pretty much just came back, don't bother.  Return 
to the area where you cameout of the hole and take the Southwest door this 
time.  Follow the linear path, past the ghost, past the hole and through the 
door where you'll find a young child.  Step forward to trigger a scene.  
Afterward examine the open grave which has a number written on it.  Check the 
door on the South side, since it's locked turn around and go back.  Return to 
the orphanage (the Wish House) and speak with Jasper out front.  Jasper is 
very thirsty and yearning for some chocolate, so you know what to do.  Press 
square and cycle to the Chocolate Milk and press square again.  Offer him the 
chocolate milk and he gives you the -Blood-Inscribed Spade-.  This time take 
the lower right (or Southeast) door.  There are four of those monstrous 
canines and a couple buzzers going around.  Watch out for the one dog that has 
a somewhat red tint to it, this is a more powerful version of the normal ones.  
Go through the next area after this and then you'll find yourself in front of 
a large, off looking tree.  On the back of this tree there are some hands 
coming up out of the ground.  Use your Spade here to dig up the -Rusted
Bloody Key-.  Now try and go back the way you came, notice that the previous 
screen loops forever.  That is because you are holding the Rusted Bloody Key, 
read the description of the key and re-read the memo you found in the car to 
learn why you are looping, and how to solve it.  Go through the East gate and 
climb the steps.  There is a hole here, but before going into it, check the 
left side on the ground for a -6-Iron-.  Now enter the hole back home.

Deposite the key in your chest along with anything else you don't need, allow 
yourself time to fully heal, save the game and return to the Forest World.  
Now you can freely run back to the Wish House without any trouble.  Enter the 
hole to return to your apartment and put the Rusted Bloody Key into your 
inventory again.  Return to the Forest World and use the key to open the Wish 
House.  Examien the scribbled notes in front of the cabinet then read the memo 
on the ground in the corner at the end of the room beside the door.  Now when 
you hear crying, examine the door beside the memo you just read to get the
-Source Placard- then go through the door to trigger a cutscene inside.

Stand up and begin to run around the circular path until you find a memo on 
the ground.  Read the memo and then keep running until you have done a full 
circle according to your map.  Now take a look at your map, this is important 
because it is how I will reference the rooms.  Each floor has the same basic 
layout as this, there are eight rooms in the circle.  Pretend the rooms are 
like the numbers on a clock face.  There are no rooms exactly up, down, left 
or right, meaming no 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock.  Every 
other number is on there.  Just to make it easier to avoid confusion I will 
refer to them in two ways.  If I say up-right room, I mean from the exact 
middle at the top, the room on the right.  Up-right would be different from 
right-up though, right-up means from the exact middle of the right side, one 
room up.  It's beside the room I mentioned first.  Since this may also sound 
complicated I'll just use both.  First go to the down-right (5 o'clock) room.  
You'll know you understood directions right if this is the room with the 
crying man inside.  There's nothing you can do for him now.  Head to the left-
up (10 o'clock) cell and go inside.  Read the note and just... bask in the 
creepyness.  The last room to go into the the right-up (2 o'clock) room.  
Inside you will find -Pistol Bullets- on the bed.  Now it's time to leave this 
cell block area.  Take the lagre double doors located on the South side.

There is a hole in this room as well as two other doors apart from the one you 
came from.  Take the door leading West.  Climb down the red ladder directly in 
front of you and at the bottom, face West and start running.  Keep an eye on 
the ground, you will pass a small object after five seconds or so, it is the 
-Saint Medallion-.  Ignore the ladder at the bottom and go through the door.  
Watch out for the buzzing things here, they are flying around.  You'll see a 
hole on the far side of the wall, though you haven't really encountered 
anything yet to hurt you very much.  Read the sign that is kind of posted in 
the middle to get the -Water Prison Exit Key-.  Read the sign afterward.  Now 
remember that red ladder you passed on the way down just before entering this 
room?  Go back and climb up that ladder.  Run in the opposite direction you 
did when you came down (counterclockwise) to get back up to that room with the 
hole.  Check the memo on the wall beside the hole and go back through it.

You will notice when you leave the bedroom that the television is on.  No 
matter how hard you try you cannot turn it off, so don't even bother trying.  
Notice that another note has been slipped under your front door, be sure to 
read this one.  Afterward head back to the washroom and re-enter the hole.

The key you found at the bottom is used to open the door in this room leading 
East.   Right when you get outside there is a ladder beside you, climb up it.  
Now climb up the other one to reach a set of large double doors.  Go through 
the doors.  Really the only room of interest here si the up-right (1 o'clock) 
room.  There's a diary in it that you can read, that's it.  When you're ready 
to go then leave the cell area and head back to the outdoor walkway.  There's 
a ladder next to the double doors, climb up it.  Climb it a second time to 
reach the roof and go through the doors.  Run around behind the large tank in 
the centre and turn the handle to open the gate.  Leave the roof area and 
climb back down the ladder once, enter the cell block here.  Run around this 
area to find two large two-headed enemies.  Personally if I were you, I'd pull 
out the Pistol for these things, and make sure to stomp them right away after 
you do.  Enter the up-right (1 o'clock) room and kill the wall man above the 
-Pistol Bullets-.  Also be sure to check out the two diaries in the right-down 
(four o'clock) room.  When you're ready to proceed go to the left-down (eight 
o'clock) room.  There is a hole in this room, drop down... three times.  

Be ready with your weapon because you aren't alone down in the shower room.  
Unlock the door and exit the shower room.  Run up and climb the ladder in the 
middle.  Read the memo sitting on the desk.  Feel free to look through the 
holes, now climb the ladder up to the next floor and read the document on the 
desk.  Climb the ladder once again and read the memo on the wall.  The secret 
number for getting through the door will be here.  You don't have to right it 
down, it will always be in your scrapbook.  Turn the handle here to the right 
once and the man on the first floor should be set free.  Climb down the ladder 
three times to reach the basement and trigger a cutscene.  Go through the 
South door and there should be a ladder just West of here.  Climb up and go 
through the door beside you.  Feel free to make a return trip to your 
apartment to save your game and heal up.  Once you're ready, head back.

Leave this room through the East door which takes you outside again.  CLimb 
the ladders to reach the third floor cell area.  This time enter the right-
down room (four o'clock) and jump down the hole.  Before jumping a second 
time, check the table on the left to get a -Stun Gun-.  Drop down to the very 
bottom to reach the Dining Hall.  Go through the North door to find the 
kitchen, but it's too dark to punch numbers into the panel.  The solution 
follows.  Leave the kitchen and the dining hall, climb the ladder in the 
middle to reach the surveillance room again.  Go up to the second floor 
surveillance room and turn the handle to the right four times.  Now climb up 
to the top and turn the handle to the right once.  All of the bloody beds 
should be lined up now, you can use the peepholes to verify.  Return to the 
kitchen once again and now the panel is illuminated.  Examine the door to get 
the -Watchfulness Placard-.  Check your scrapbook (press triangle on the map 
screen) and read the secret number memo, this is the number you need to punch 
into the door.  Put in the code and the door should open, triggering a scene.

Run down the alley and around the corner to the next area.  Run down the 
stairs to find a new type of enemy, one of the crazy monkeys.  Use either your 
Steel Pipe or Stun Gun on it (Stun Gun works much better.)  Run down to the 
bottom of the stairs and watch the cutscene.  Afterward defeat the crazy 
monkeys and enter the room.  There is a dead guy, or dead ghost, lying on the 
ground.  Examine his body to get the -Ghost's Key-.  After getting the key 
examine the body a second time to get the -Sword of Obedience-.  Quickly go 
through the door before the ghost gets up, because he will.  It's a pretty 
linear path here, run down a few flights of stairs to get to the bottom and 
head through the door.  Run up the hall and go thorugh the door on your right 
(West.)  Get the -Pistol Bullets- off the shelf and go through the North door.  
Notice there are a number of baseball bats against the wall here, pick up the 
one on the ground to get the -Aluminum Bat-.  There's also a -5-Iron- on the 
ground on the other side.  You're probably carrying a lot of things now so use 
the hole here to return to your apartment.  You won't really need the Steel 
Pipe anymore, might as well dump the golf club.  You can dump the Sword of 
Obedience as well, and even the pistol.  Hang on to the Stun Gun, the Aluminum 
Bat, and bring the Saint Medallion as well, along with perhaps a healing item.  
Now answer that damn knock at your door (in this game, answer means look out 
through the peephole.)  After this check through the peephole in the wall to 
see what's going on with Eileen, then back to the bathroom and into the hole.

Take the North door out of the room and go down the stairs, then enter the 
door at the bottom.  This is a great place to test out that new bat, there's 
dogs wandering around in this room.  Down at the end of one of the aisles you 
will find a key on the shelf near someboxes, pick up the -Albert's Sports
Key-.  Now that you have the key, return to the room with the hole where you 
found the bat, that's the sports shop.  The key works on the door on the West 
wall.  Run down the stairs using your Stun Gun to kill any crazy monkey men 
along the way.  At the bottom of the stairs there is a thin walkway leading 
East, go through the door at the end to find yourself on an elevator.  After 
the scene when you get off the elevator, go through the South door and pick up 
the -Pistol Bullets- from the ground.  Enter the elevator again and examine 
the button panel, choose to press the top button.  Take the door on the 
opposite side (North) out of the elevator and ready to run down the hall.  The 
hallway here is very thin and populated by ghosts, be careful.  Remember that 
the Saint's Medallion will negate the evil effect of ghosts.  Run as fast as 
you can to the end of the hall where you will find a -Spade- and a -Sword
of Obedience-.  Return to the elevator and press the bottom button.

Take the ladder on the North side down to the lower floor.  There is a 
-Nutrition Drink- on the North side beside one of the pillars.  Head down the 
hall leading West but not before taking out those long dangly tentacles.  
Climb the ladder to reach the top, watch out for the monkey men here.  There's 
also dogs wandering around, this area can get very difficult.  Don't worry 
about checking the doors, just rn down to the end of the alley until you hit 
the next screen.  Many more monkey men here, stay away from the door for most 
of the time, the one there won't move unless you get close.  Eventually once 
the time does come to fight him be careful because he's equipped with a 
Pitching Wedge!  You're free to pick up the -Pitching Wedge- once he's dead of 
course.  Descend down the stairs and go through the door on the East side at 
the bottom.  Keep going down again until you hit the bottom, there are a 
number of doors here.  Go through the door on the South wall.  There's a 
-Rusty Axe- sitting on a stool near the door.  Also read the Bartender's Memo 
which is on the counter.  Henry happens to live on South Ashfield Street, 
perhaps the answer lies in his apartment.  Back into the hole you go!

Examine your chest and get ready to switch up the old inventory.  I would drop 
the Pitching Wedge, the Aluminum Bat, the Pistol (if you haven't already) and 
hang onto the Rusty Axe, Stun Gun, Spade, and Saint Medallion.  Look out your 
living room window and check left, there should be a large billboard that says 
"Bar Southfield 555-3750."  Save your game and go back into the hole.Examine 
the door and input the number "3750" to unlock it.  There are ghosts in this 
area so it may be a good idea to use the Saint Medallion here.  Run up about 
eight billion flights of stairs and examine the door at the top to get the 
-Chaos Placard-.  Enter the room and watch the scene before it fades.

Begin by turning around and going into room 301.  Walk over to the desk and 
read the diary.  Grab the slip of -Red Paper- from the table then go into the 
bedroom and read the magazine on the bed.  Equip the Saint Medallion then 
examine the two red posters on the wall.  One contains -Locker Key #106- and 
the other contains -Superintendent's Key-.  Getting this key will make a ghost 
appear in the room, which is why you equipped the medallion.  Run out of the 
room and unequip it.  Go to your door, Room 302, and use the Red Paper to 
slide it under the door.  Now run to the end of the hall and go through the 
door.  On the staircase the long haired man is there, speak to him and he'll 
offer you the doll.  It is up to you whether you want to pick it up or not, it 
isn't required.  If you do, then you'll get the -Shabby Doll-.  Run down to 
the bottom of the stairs and beside the little desk table with the lamp, are 
some lockers.  Open your inventory and use Locker Key #106.  Nothing important 
really, so climb through the hole on the opposite wall to get back.

Examine the two red pieces of paper under your door.  Check through the 
peephole to see if anything is there, then save your game and dump the doll in 
the chest if you picked it up.  Now climb back into the hole to get to the 
Apartment World again and go through the double doors leading West.  Use the 
Superintendent's Key on the first door on your left.  Check out the pieces of 
paper on the side of the room to get -Red Paper- and -Torn Red Paper-.  Beside 
it there are some keys hanging on the wall, examine ti to get -Apartment 
Keys-.  Head into the bedroom and read the diary on the table.  Now leave this 
room and go up the hall, and into the first room on the right.  Check the 
bedroom to find a -Portable Medical Kit-.  Sitting on the end table is a 
phone, do not dial the numbers, it will just make enemies appear.  Down at the 
end of the hall, room 107, has some interesting stereo equipment but not much 
else.  Return to the room with the hole and lockers and such.  Proceed through 
the doors on the opposite side, leading into the East hall.  There are a 
couple of dogs in this room, you can take care of them easily with your Rusty 
Axe or Spade.  Look around for the room marked 102 and go inside it.  

Stomp on all the leeches in here.  If you've beaten the game before and 
unlocked it, you'll find the -Submachine Gun- here.  Your mail goal in this 
room is to open the fridge and get the -Torn Red Paper- from inside.  Run to 
the end of the hall and go into Room 101.  Unfortunately the only thing in 
this room that's actually real are the -Pistol Bullets- on the counter.  Run 
back up to the third floor where you started.  Put the Red Paper and two 
pieces of Torn Red Paper under your door, Room 302.  Now enter Room 304 and 
grab the -Pistol Bullets- from the bedroom.  Descend down to the second floor 
and go thorugh the doors leading into the East hallway.  Ignore Room 204 and 
enter Room 203, perhaps with the Saint Medallion equipped.  On the floor in 
the middle of the living room is a bottle of -Bug Spray-.  Also check the 
bloody shirt in the bedroom to get another piece of -Torn Red Paper-.  That's 
all there is to do here, return to the stairs area and head through to the 
West hallway on the second floor.  Go through the first door on the left and 
pick up the -"Skinned Mike" Cassette- from the coffee table.  The next room 
you want to go into is Room 207.  Pick up -Richard's Revolver- from the 
electric chair.  Also check the bedroom to find a -Putter-.  Climb back up to 
the third floor again and put the Torn Red Paper under your door, this should 
be the fourth one.  Use the hole in Room 301 to return to your apartment.  
Read all four of the pieces of paper under the door and then return to your 
room.  You'll find the -Doll Key- between your bed and the window.  Go back 
through the hole to the Apartment World and open Eileen's door for a scene.

Look out your window when you wake up, then go into the living room and look

paper under the door and get the -Succubus Talisman- from under there as well.  
You're free to listen to that Casette Tape if you want, the stereo is beside 
the television.  Now open your chest and put everything in there except the 
Succubus Talisman and a weapon.  Also take out the Chaos Placard, Watchfulness 
Placard, Source Placard and Temptation Placard.  Enter the bathroom and take a 
look at the hole.  Now go into the laundry room, the one beside you front 
door.  There is something odd on the wall, look at it and use the Succubus 
Talisman.  Now there are four indentations, each with words that match the 
names of your placards.  Put them in the correct slots and a hole will appear.

After leaving the room go over to the South side of this hall and pick up 
-Eileen's Bag- from the ground.  Watch out for all the buzzers, axe them to 
death with the power of your axe.  There are two doors on the East side, go 
through the upper one.  Read the memo on the desk and take a look at the 
board.  Now exit through the North door.  You'll find a -Paper Cutting Knife- 
on the desk here.  Leave this room now, notice there are three doors on the 
West side of this area, take the third one down from the top.  Sitting on a 
shelf you'll find a -Nutrition Drink-.  Now when you're ready, enter the 
bottom West door.  Get ready to swing your axe with full power the second you 
get in here.  These things are so powerful that sometimes it takes two stomps 
to really kill them.  Take a look on the shelves for something that stands 
out, you'll find an -Ampoule- which pretty much restores almost all of your 
health and has a regenerative effect.  Leave the room and go into the one 
directly opposite it, there is a -Portable Medical Kit- on the table in here, 
that's about it.  You've found quite a bit of crap already and you only just 
got here.  If your inventory is getting full you might want to return to your 
apartment and dump somestuff off, most of these medical supplies will be 
unnecessary at this point and there's little reason to carry around that 
knife.  Drop everything with the exception of the Rusty Axe and Eileen's 
Handbag.  Coming up is a section where you'll get a hell of a lot of items.

Head to the very South end of the large hall and go into the room beside the 
elevator on the East side.  Ascend the stairs and go through the door.  
There's a hallway here with tons of rooms and crazy wheelchairs moving up and 
down the hall.  The chairs can hurt you but you can't hurt them so just stay 
out of the way.  Unfortunately while the rooms don't actually change, their 
positions are random.  Basically this means that the room beside the stairs 
for me might have a bed and nothing else, while the room beside the stairs for 
you might have enemies and some X-Rays or something.  You'll still find the 
room with just the bed, but perhaps it might be down the hall.  I'll just 
describe them in the order I find them, starting on the same side as the 
stairs.  Enter the room beside the stairs and walk across the sticky floor to 
find -Pistol Bullets- beside the bed.  Next is a pointless room with a bunch 
of X-Rays.  Next is a room with a falling spike roof that almost lands on your 
head but doesn't, nothing in here.  Next is a room with some skin on the bed 
and a bunch of things stuck in it, you'll find -Pistol Bullets- in here.  Next 
there's a weird room with a bed handing under the floor, after that a room 
where it's raining inside.  Next a room with a broken bed and a -Nutrition
Drink-.  After that a room with hooks hanging on the walls.  After that is a 
room with a wheelchair and some -Revolver Bullets-.  Next is a room with a
-Holy Candle- in it.  Next comes the fabled "face" room.  Across the hall now 
is a locked door then a room with a cobra holding a -Hospital Room Key-.  Use 
the key to unlock the cage when it falls.  This key will unlock the locked 
door, but don't do that until you're done exploring the other rooms.  The next 
room has a -Nutrition Drink- in it.  Next there's a nice room with another 
-Saint Medallion-.  Next is a room with a number of baby chambers.  After this 
is a room with broken glass and a -4-Iron- on the ground.  Next is a room with 
a cloth over something with legs coming out the bottom.  After there's a 
patient enemy in the room and nothing else of interest.  Next there's some 
kimbs on the bed and finally a room with two patient enemies.  That's it.

In case you're interested, you should have found the following items:  Pistol 
Bullets, Pistol Bullets, Nutrition Drink, Revolver Bullets, Holy Candle, 
Hospital Room Key, Nutrition Drink, and 4-Iron not necessarily in that order.  
Head back to the room which was locked, the one at the far end on the left 
assuming it isn't random and use the Hospital Room Key.  After a scene Eileen 
will start following you around.  If you have Eileen's Bag with you then open 
your inventory and equip it, it's a weapon for her.  Leave this room and the 
instant you do, begin charging up your Rusty Axe.  You probably won't be able 
to see too well because of the camera, but in this hall the wheelchairs have 
been replaced by two patients.  Kill them then run to the South end and press 
the button to call the elevator up, don't gon inside though, instead head back 
downstairs.  Make sure Eileen is right behind you when you go through doors 
otherwise you'll leave her behind.  There are two more patient demons on the 
first floor, be careful.  Enter the washroom and go back through the hole.

At this point, your apartment changes, and not for the better.  The most 
notable of these changes is that you are no longer healed when you return 
here, so the carelessness you have enjoyed in combat up to this point must 
change to carefulness.  Leave your room and head into the living room, take a 
look at your ceiling fan, then go get the envelope from under the door.  It 
has a -Small Key- in it.  Also check beside your bookshelf, the one with the 
radio on it, there should be three pieces of red paper.  Dump most of the crap 
you found into the bin.  Now that you can't heal in the room anymore you might 
want to consider keeping a Portable Medical Kit with you at all times.  I 
would take the Rusty Axe, Portable Medical Kit, Eileen's Bag, Small Key and 
perhaps a Saint Medallion, you never know when it might come in handy.  Once 
you're ready then head back into the hole in your laundry room.

Leave the room after the scene and go into the elevator, since it should be on

that you found will unlock the gate in the shaft.  Begin charging up your

the patients in this hall and stomp them into the ground.  Go through the door 
at the bottom and run down the spiraling path.  Ignore the stairs on your left

All right, time to learn about hauntings, because they're going to start now.  
A haunting is like a ghost presance, when you are near it, the screen will go 
red and you will begin to take damage.  The difference is that in most cases 
there is no ghost, it's just an oddity, and they are found in your apartment.  
There are two steps, the first is detecting and locating, the second is 
eliminating.  Detecting is easy and is made possible by your radio, go and 
turn it on now.  If the radio is silent then there are no hauntings in your 
apartment, if it's loud then there are.  You can find a haunting either by an 

odd physical disturbance, or just the fact that when you stand near it the 
screen goes red.  I won't spil it by explaining the details of each one, but 
you'll know them when you see them.  Once you've located the haunting you can 
get rid of it in two ways.  Those Holy Candles you have, this is what they are 
for.  Get to the centre of the haunting source and set the Holy Candle down on 
some surface, let it burn and it should gradually get rid of the haunting for 
you.  The other is to equip a Saint Medallion and just walk into it, but the 
Saint Medallion will break quickly (and Holy Candles bur out too of course, 
you won't have an infinitely usable fix for them.)  Anyway once your apartment 
is free of hauntings, check under your door for a piece of red paper and an 
envelope with a -Toy Key- inside.  Open the chest and get the Lynch Street 
Line Coin and a Sword of Obedience out of it, you'll need them. Now head back.

Leave the washroom, equip the Saint Medallion, and head down the hall toward 
the turnstiles.  Prepare for you first boss fight, sort of.  You don't have to 
fight this boss but opting out of doing so means she will not go away, and she 
will reappear.  Here's what you do, equip the Rusty Axe and start smacking.  
Don't use the change up attack, just keep hitting her until she falls, THEN 
use the charge up attack.  After doing so see if you can stomp on her corpse.  
This won't kill her, but it will mean that it's time to use the Sword of 
Obedience.  The next time you knock her down, don't attack or stomp, hit 
square to use the sword and pin her to the ground.  Continue past the 
turnstiles to the next area.  Defeat the monkey men and go into the little 
area to the West before the worm to find -Nutrition Drink-.  Past the worm 
down the East path get the -Silver Bullets-.  Return to the turnstiles and use 
the Lynch Street Line Coin again to get thorugh.  Descend the stairs and go 
left and down the hall toward the dead end where you'll find another 
-Nutrition Drink-.  Just back a bit before the drink, look agains tthe wall to 
find a -Riding Crop- in the pile.  Equip it while standing beside Eileen, it's 
a new weapon for her.  Return to the hall and keep going down the stairs.  

Enter the subway car at the bottom and go right, up, and left back into the 
car.  Remember that colourful box from the beginning of the game?  Use your 
Toy Key to open it now and get the -Filthy Coin-.  Return to the bottom of the 
stairs and make your way all the way down to the South end, go through the 
very last open subway door (not the one you have to open yourself, this one is 
already open).  Head right into the next car and look on the ground above you 
to find a -Saint Medallion-.  Leave the subway cars once again and go thorugh 
the far South door on the wall.  In the event this door is locked it means you 
are either just coming to this guide for help at this point, or just suck at 
following it.  I say this because earlier in the station i told you to go out 
of your way to unlock this door, hopefully you did, if not you'll be able to 
get to the same place by going through all the subway cars and around a 
different path.  Your destination is that underground weird walkway with the 
wooden boards to walk across.  Anyway assuming you have been following the 
guide, climb down the ladder after picking up the -Holy Candle-.  At the 
bottom go down and head right at the fork.  If you have room in your inventory 
(I don't) then pick up the -Nutrition Drink-, if not, then just remember it's 
there because you're can come back afterward if you want.  Head back a few 
steps and go down at the fork this time, climb the other ladder.  There is a 
hole at the top here, return to your apartment so you can dump things off.

If your radio is making noise (assuming you turned it on) then you'll have to 
get rid of a haunting first.  I find at this point it's usually the one in the 
kitchen, take your Holy Candle and go set it on the counter beside your shoes.  
If it's not that one then obviously put it somewhere else.  Open the chest and 
drop Eileen's Bag, any Saint Medallions, the Lynch Street Line Coin, and the 
Silver Bullets.  Hang onto the Filthy Coin for now, maybe a health item if 
you're paranoid, and maybe one Saint Medallion.  Head over to your sink and 
use the Filthy Coin to get the -1& Coin-.  Read the piece of red paper under 
your door.  Now if you're set, jump back into the hole again.  Go through the 
door leading North and charge your Rusty Axe to slash those damn dogs.  Run 
North while kepping an eye on the benches to your left to find -Pistol 
Bullets-.  When you pass the stairs, turn around and go up to find a -Portable 
Medical Kit-.  Back down again, enter the subway car at the end and go left to 
find a -Holy Candle- on the ground.  Now run all the way back to the South end 
and go through the door, and down the ladder.  Grab the Nutrition Drink is you 
didn't before and keep going in that direction, perhaps with a Saint Medallion 
equipped.  Head out to the open area King Street Line subway platform.

You need to go up the escalator.  Make sure you kill all the wall men on your 
way up, in fact you might even want to consider going up the down escalator.  
The reason for this is that the wall men don't come back once they're dead, 
and you'll be bringing Eileen back this way, so it will save you a lot of 
trouble in the long run.  At the top, run down the hall leading North and get 
the -Nutrition Drink-.  Leave this area and ascend the stairs.  Get 
-Cynthia's Commuter Ticket- off the floor at the top of the stairs and use it 
on the turnstile to get out of here.  You don't need the Lynch Street Line 
Coin, use the Commuter Ticket again instead of the coin and it lets you 
through.  Head down the stairs and at the bottom, use the 1& Coin on the 
vending machine with the same symbol to get the -Murder Scene Key-.  Before 
going back up the stairs where you just came from (which you are going to do) 
run to the end of the platform and get Eileen out of the room.  Now head to 
the top of the stairs where the turnstiles are and use the Commuter Ticket to 
get into the King Street Line again.  Open the door to the room where Cynthia 
died using the Murder Scene Key and pick up the -Train Handle- off the floor.  
Go down the stairs and down the escalator.  Enter the train car and run to the 
end where you can use the train handle.  Now a few steps back the door is open 
leading North down into a new tunnel.  Beside the door you will find a -Sword 
of Obedience-.  Through the door there's a scene and then a boss!  A boss you 
cannot harm at all, to defeat him, go thorugh the door, that's it.  This place 
should look familiar, run to the very and and go through the door.

There are two tombstone-esque things in the graveyard with red writing that 
you can't read, approach them with Eileen and try to read them, she should 
interrupt and read them out to you.  Examine the torch at the Northwest corner 
to acquire -Torch-.  Examine it again to light the torch (after equipping it) 
and quickly run through the door.  Follow the path for a few steps then look 
left for a well, when you examine it you'll get the -Doll's Head-.  At this 
point you may have noticed the long haired man in the coat has followed you 
thorugh the door, he has a gun and he's not afraid to fire.  Run!  Quickly 
grab the -Nutrition Drink- from under the lamp post and run like hell.  Don't 
run too fast though.  Head back to the Wish House area.  So much for that 
thing.  Run to the middle of it and you'll find a memo on the ground.  Also 
look for a wheelchair in the middle of it, when you examine it there's a memo.  
Use the Doll's Head here then grab the -Holy Candle- on your left.  Hanging 
from the broken playground pieces on the East side is a chain, go over there 
and pick up the -Chain-.  It's a new weapon for Eileen, have her equip it.  
You can dump the Riding Crop now, head back through the hole to the North.

Exercise any hauntings around your apartment and then check under the front 
door for a piece of red paper.  Drop anything you don't need into the chest, 
this includes the Commuter Ticket but does not include the Torch or the Sword 
of Obedience, you need those.  Enter the laundry room now, below the hole and 
a little to the left is a canister of oil.  Use your Torch on it to soak the 
Torch in oil.  Now head back through the hole to reach the Forest World.

If you're ready to continue then take the upper left door (according to the 
map) out of this area.  Charge your Rusty Axe and bring it down on those damn 
two headed freaks.  There's a -Nutrition Drink- on the ground just before the 
door.  There's all sorts of stuff in this next room, on the right you will 
find -Pistol Bullets-.  At the upper left is a -Nutrition Drink- and beside it 
on the ground is the -Pickaxe of Despair-, the strongest weapon in the game.  
Leave this room and go left for a cutscene.  Afterward examine the pedestal 
beside you to get -Crested Medallion- and you'll find -Revolver Bullets- to 
the North as well.  Since you're probably overloaded on stuff, return to your 
apartment through the hole here and dump it all.  Be sure to keep the Axe or 
the Pickaxe, the Torch, the Chain, Sword of Obedience, and Crested Medallion.

You'll need the Torch equipped, light it with the flame beside the exit to 
this area.  Now run back toward the Wish House.  Ignore the victims in this 
area, but make sure to wait for Eileen before going through the door.  On the 
path here there is another well, examine it to get the -Doll's Right Leg-.  
Return to the Wish House and use the Doll's Right Leg on the doll.  Now take 
the upper right door, run down this path to the next area and at this point 
check immediately on your left for another well with -Doll's Left Arm- inside.  
Assuming you soaked the torch in oil, it should easily still be burning at 
this point.  Remember this is the room with that large ugly sack that fell 
down in the middle.  Contine along the path, still going away from the Wish 
House.  Unequip your torch before going through the door.  

You'll probably need the Rusty Axe for this one, I find the Pickaxe of Despair 
just doesn't have a fast enough recovery time time to allow you to strike and 
then jam the Sword of Obedience before he is able to get up.  When fighting, 
just be sure to keep your distance most of the time and you should be fine.  
Eileen can pull her own weight.  Re-equip the Torch and use the flame to light 
it, now continue East.  Run through the next area to reach the factory.  
Here's an interesting tip, if you take off Eileen's weapon then she won't 
waste time trying to fight the ghosts and actually bother to keep up, it might 
really help you out.  You can find a -Nutrition Drink- on the far East side, 
after grabbing it head South to the door.  Follow the linear path through the 
factory, along the path after it, and when you come to an area with one of 
those monkey men, examine the well on your left to get -Doll's Right Arm-.  
Defeat the enemy and pick up the -Holy Candle- off the ground.  Before going, 
grab the -Nutrition Drink- from behind the fence near the gate.  Return to the 
Wish House are and place those limbs back on the doll.  Now take the final 
door you haven't taken yet, the lower right one.  Run along the path, picking 
up the -Nutrition Drink- along the way.  In the next area get ready to run 
because the man in the coat is back, and he's replaced his Steel Pipe with a 
Chainsaw!  When you make it through, in the next section look on the other 
side of the weird tree to find -Silver Bullets-.  Finally, through the gate 
light the Torch and examine the well to get -Doll's Left Leg- as well as a 
-Nutrition Drink- on the ground.  Now head through the hole once again.

Use that Holy Candle on whatever crazy hauntings are occurring in your 
apartment.  Drop the following items into the chest, Silver Bullets, Nutrition 
Drinks, and the Torch.  Now head back to the Forest World.  Make your way back 
to the Wish House and place the final piece of the doll, on the doll.  It will 
roll out of the way and reveal a staircase which you can take down.  Read the 
bokk sitting on the table at the bottom.  Place the Crested Medallion into the 
door and run down the spiral staircase to revisit the Water Prison World.

Enter the elevator thing and watch the scene.  At the bottom, prepare 
yourself.  Take off any weapon Eileen is carrying and when you go through the 
door get ready to run, all you have to do is run a few steps down and through 
the double doors.  The danger is the long haired coat, he's replaced his 
Chainsaw this time with another Pistol.  Outside on the walkway now, start 
running.  Since Eileen can't climb ladders you need to take the long way, but 
once you start running he'll be chasing, so keep running!  Go thorugh the 
first door to reach the third floor cell area.  Start by going into the left-
down (8 o'clock) room and getting the -Pistol Bullets-.  Next head into the 
right-up room (2 o'clock) and grab the -Holy Candle-.  Once you've done this 
then your destination is the up-right (1 o'clock) room.  Drop down the hole, 
then again, then again.  When you reach the kitchen, go thorugh the door with 
the number panel to reach the death chamber.  Examine the shirt on the ground 
to get -Prisoner's Shirt-.  Head back into the kitchen and out the other door.  
There are two items in this room, a -Nutrition Drink- and a -Saint Medallion-.  
The medallion is on the floor near the exit door.  Leave this room and kill 
the damn tentacle things blocking the ladder.  Climb to the third floor and 
get the -Nightstick-.  Back down at the bottom of the ladder go through the 
West door and pick up the -Pistol Bullets-.  Now take the South door from the 
previous room.  Ascend the ladder and go through the door at the top, pick up 
the -Nutrition Drink- sitting beside the hole and enter the hole once again.

Drop the following items off in the chest, the Holy Candle, the Saint 
Medallion, all those Pistol Bullets, and if you still had it unequipped, 
Eileen's Chain (since the Nightstick is better).  There should be a piece of 
red paper under your door so look for it, then go into the bathroom.  Use the 
Prisoner's Shirt on the bathtub to be able to read it.  Now jump through the 
hole back to the Water Prison World.  Proceed through the North door to reach 
the first floor cell block.  Enter the down-right (5 o'clock) room to find 
some -Pistol Bullets-.  There's a -Nutrition Drink- in the down-left (7 
o'clock) room.  Be sure to go into the left-up (10 o'clock) room to find a 
-Holy Candle-.  That's all there is to do here, go back out and through the 
East door to reach the outdoor walkway.  Climb the ladder to the second floor 
cell block door.  For this part, go into the down-right (5 o'clock) door and 
get the -Pistol Bullets-.  Next go into the down-left (7 o'clock) room.  This 
is the room the note on the shirt was talking about, examine the bed to get a 
-Sword of Obedience-.  Lastly, go into the up-left (11 o'clock) room, there's 
an enemy in here, your main goal is to pick up the -Holy Candle- off the 
floor.  Leave the room and climb the ladder up to the third floor again.

Check your map for a red marker icon, this is Eileen of course, go into the 
room and retrieve her.  Leave this whole cell area and begin running down the 
long winding walkway, being extra careful, because the friggin coat man is 
here.  Wait for Eileen at the bottom and go through the door, then through the 
hole.  At this point you should have enough candles to exercise any hauntings 
your apartment may throw at you.  If at any point you have been wondering the 
purpose of those Silver Bullets, now is when you're going to find out.  Wipe 
the rust off that Pistol and take one Silver Bullet, forget normal bullets 
entirely.  You'll also have to have your Sword of Obedience of course, and 
hang onto the Rusty Axe and Nightstick.  Lastly, if I were you, I'd take a 
Portable medical kit.  Things might be starting to get a little dangerous.  

When your arrive back again, go into your inventory and press square on the 
Silver Bullet to load it.  Equip the Rusty Axe and head through the West door 
for a scene.  Now use the axe to cut through those tentacle things on your way 
down the path until you encounter the ghost, change equipment to the Pistol 
and hang on for a second.  The ghost has a single attack but it's dangerous 
and powerful, he'll spin around then launch at you.  During this time when he 
is spinning, that is your best chance to fire.  Immediately after firing run 
up to the ghost and use the Sword of Obedience.  I used the Rusty Axe on him 
for awhile but he never even fell down, the Silver Bullet is the way to go 
here.  In the event you can't pin him after one bullet then you'll have to 
switch over to the Rusty Axe but it's VERY difficult to fight this guy without 
being hit, those lunge attacks just devistate.  You must use the Sword of 
Obedience on this guy, doing so automatically gets you the -Water Prison 
Generator Room Key-.  Run to the very bottom with Eileen following you and go 
through the door.  At the end of this room, across from the hole on the ground 
(it's somehwat difficult to see) there is a -Portable Medical Kit- (thank god) 
so if you took a lot of damage from that fight, use it.  Head over to the 
upper right side door and use the Water Prison Generator Room Key on it.  

This is where things get interesting, walk forward a few steps so you can see 
down the long hallway, you might happen to notice there are many figures down 
at the end.  It's time for a bloodbath, and you're the axe wielding 
executioner.  Whether you choose to charge your weapon first and walk slowly, 
to run staight into it, or to wield a gun or seomthing sissy like that, it's 
up to you to take out the trash.  Actually despite my confidence, I found 
myself wounded quite badly, so if you're in the same boat then exit through 
the door at the end of the hall and use the hole on the way down the spiral 
staircase to return to your apartment and heal up.  Since you used your Silver 
Bullet you'll need another one for the boss in this world.  Also you should 
have one Sword of Obedience left if you've been following the guide.  If you 
don't carry a Spirit Medallion with you at all times this may be a good time 
to start.  Back into the hole you go then through the door to Building World.

Right away read the diary on the ground after the scene.  Beside the door you 
just came from on the left as well is a -Nutrition Drink-.  Wait for Richard 
to appear then get ready to fire, in between all those fresh dance moves he's 
got.  Here's what you do, stand somewhere away from him and hold R2.  Wait 
until he is right in front of you for maximum accuracy and bullet ripping 
power and fire.  He should go down right there and allow you to jam that Sword 
of Obedience directly into him.  I found it a fair bit easier than doing it to 
Andrew.  Enter the elevator and press the bottom button.  Descend the ladder 
when it reaches the bottom and down at the end of the hall you'll find a 
-Billiard Ball- on the floor.  Climb up the ladder beside where you found the 
ball.  There's nothing to do in this alley besides just running to the end.  
After the scene grab the -Portable Medical Kit- beside you and head South.  
Sitting beside next to the water tower on the opposite side on the ground, 
beside the ladder, is a -Saint Medallion-.  You might have trouble seeing it.  
Also beside it is a -Volleyball-, pick that up as well.  Proceed through the 
door then descend the stairs and go through the door at the bottom.  You'll 
find a -Holy Candle- around the other side of this walkway.  Now go down the 
stairs to he bottom and enter the bar again.  Walk over to the pool table and 
use the Billiard Ball to set it down on the table.  Read the bartender's memo 
on the counter and then enter the hole to get back to your apartment.

Take a look under your front door for another piece of red paper.  Drop the 
Pistol into the chest, save your game and return to the Building World.  Time 
for a lot fo backtracking, leave the room through the way you came, head back 
up all these stairs and the next ones past the wheelchairs.  At the top run 
down the alley and down the ladder at the end.  Climb up the ladder on the 
other side of this area, now you should be in the elevator with Eileen.  If 
you entered the wrong elevator, go into the one Eileen is in.  Of the two 
elevators, you should be in the Eastern one.  Ride the elevator to the top 
floor and go out the door facing North.  Defeat the monkey men and run to the 
end of the hall, you'll find -Revolver Bullets-, and that's about all.  Re-
enter the elevator and take the other door out, still on the top floor.  Go 
down the hall and pick up the -Nutrition Drink- in the next area before 
killing the two dogs.  Ascend the stairs and go through the door at the top.  
Pick up the -3-Wood- off the floor and the -Cake Candles- off the counter.  
Use the Volleyball on the basket to drop it in.  Proceed through the door 
beside the hole and get the -Holy Candle-.  Go through the East door and then 
the East door again after that.  Climb the stairs to the top, preferably with 
your Saint Medallion equipped and Eileen unequipped.  Through the door at the 
top you will find a -Stuffed Cat- on the ground.  You may notice there is a 
cake on the table, use the candles on it to set them in place, take the door 
out of this room leading South.  There are two dogs here on the ground floor, 
and two more dogs on the second floor along with a -Nutrition Drink-.  On the 
third floor you'll find both a -Holy Candle- and some -Revolver Bullets- 
sitting on the hood of the car.  Follow the long alley down to the end, 
fighting the dogs as you go and pick up the -Driver- before going in the hole.

Drop those golf clubs, drop the candles (or use them if your apartment is 
haunted), drop the Revolver Bullets, drop some health items if you have any 
left.  You get the idea.  Save your game and go back into the hole.  Run down 
the hall, down the stairs through the door, keep going and blah blah blah 
eventually you'll find yourself back at the sports store again.  This time 
leave through the North door.  Climb down the stairs to the pet shop, check 
the shelves to get -Nutrition Drink- and -Pistol Bullets-.  On the Northwest 
side of the room is a cage on the counter, the camera angle changes when you 
get close.  Use the Stuffed Cat on it.  Now go further Northwest and head 
through the door.  Examine those newspapers on the ground beside the door and 
you'll hear some noise, go back in to check it out.  Head back to where the 
newspapers were and go down the stairs.  Enter the room at the bottom, it's 
all sideways and weird.  There's -Pistol Bullets- on one of the shelves, after 
grabbing them go examine the door with the clock on it.  Run all the way down 
the stairs and proceed through the door on the Southeast wall.

Tons of monkey men in this room, and one dog with them.  Take out your Risty 
Axe and get swingin'.  It's going to take some hardcore moves to eliminate all 
these guys.  They all drop golf clubs and yes you can pick them up, grab the 
-Sand Wedge-, -8-Iron-, -7-Iron-, and -3-Iron-.  There's also a -Nutrition 
Drink- around the corner.  When you're ready head for the other door.  Descend 
the stairs and go through the door, run down the alley to the next area and go 
through this door as well.  I'm sure you recognize this place anyway, 
basically you're just trying to get back to the bar again.  Given you have all 
those damn golf clubs it's probably a good idea to head back through the hole 
right about now, and by good idea, I mean you have to do it anyway.

Put everything you don't need into the chest, which is probably most of the 
crap you're carrying.  If you remember, you're going to need to know the new 
phone number of the bar.  Look out your living room window at the sign, the 
number (555-3750) has not actually changed.  The solution?  Go into your room 
and dial the number into your phone.  It will tell you that the new number is 
(555-4890).  Re-enter the hole again and punch the number 4890 into the code 
thing on the wall.  Run down many flights of stairs and grab the -Portable 
Medical Kit- at the bottom, then head through the door beside it.  This is 
kind of a boss, and kind of not.  Read the riddle on the door on the opposite 
side of the room.  What it means is that only one of these enemies is real.  
The way you tell which one is real quite easily.  Go around striking each one 
of them until you found one that when hit, makes all of them react to the hit, 
that's the real one.  Kill it and go through the door.  At the bottom of the 
spiral staircase there is a memo.  Now enter Room 302, your apartment.

Before doing so make sure to grab the -Pickaxe of Hope- from the wall at the

and go to the end of the hall.  Use the Pickaxe of Hope in the equivalent spot 
to where you found it and a hole opens up.  Go in and watch the cutscene, then 
examine the corpse to get the -Keys of Liberation-.  Use the keys on your 
front door to break open all the locks and finally get out of your room.

Head up and go into Room 301.  Run to the end of the hall and go right into 
that cylindrical cage thing to find a -Saint Medallion- on the ground.  Go 
down the stairs in the main room and get the -Nutrition Drink- on the lower 
floor.  Leave the room on this floor and run down the hall to Room 202.  Move 
quickly (but not so quick that you leave Eileen) because the man in the coat 
is behind the barrier.  Check the bedroom to find a -Sword of Obedience- on 
the ground.  Now head through the hole in the wall then leave the room.  Out 
in the hallway again, your destination is Room 204.  Coat man is here, don't 
make any odd movements, simply walk into the kitchen, grab the -Nutrition 
Drink- and leave.  When you're ready (and have a good weapon equipped) then go 
leave the hall through the West exit.  Get ready to take on like five or six 
patients, I lost count, but the point is to kill them!  After you do then 
climb up the stairs to the next floor and grab the -Pistol Bullets- off the 
ground.  Head into the third floor hallway and enter Room 304.  All you're 
doing in here is picking up the -Nutrition Drink-.  Now it's time to go into 
Eileen's room, Room 303.  Check the living room for -Revolver Bullets- and a 
-Nurse Costume- if you've beaten the game before and acquired the appropriate 
ending.  Leave this room and return to the stairway, run down to the second 
floor and enter the West hallway this time.  Go into Room 205 and you'll find 
a -Nutrition Drink- in the bedroom.  Next you'll want to head into Room 206.

Watch out for the coat man!  It's close quarters in here, you can "kill" him 
if you want to, either way enter the first bedroom to get a -Holy Candle- and 
then the second bedroom to find a crack in the wall.  Go through.  Check the 
bedroom here to find -Pistol Bullets- and then leave.  Defeat the monster and 
run down the stairs.  At the bottom is Room 107, go inside and get the 
-Nutrition Drink- out of the back storeroom.  Next you'll want to go into Room 
106.  Lots of great stuff in here including a -Portable Medical Kit, and
-Ampoule- and a -Holy Candle- in the kitchen.  Leave the room and leave this 
hall.  In the next area Eileen walks toward the middle of the room and stops.  
Don't bother trying to get her to follow you anymore.  Now enter the East 
hallway and go into Room 104.  You'll see a -Portable Medical Kit- past some 
wall men, go grab it then enter the cylindrical cage thing and examine the 
corpse.  Room 103 has another corpse to examine and a -Nutrition Drink- in the 
back room.  In the hallway again, there is a hanging corpse at the South end, 
the North end, and some -Pistol Bullets- beside the boxes.  Go into Room 101.  
You'll find another hanging corpse here and some -Pistol Bullets-.  

Return to the main area where you left Eileen and watch the scene.  Now head 
back to the West hall and go into Room 105.  Examine the red case for a scene 
and to acquire the -Umbilical Cord-.  There's also a -Nutrition Drink- in the 
back room.  Leave this room for another scene, then examine the piece of paper 
on the ground.  Climb the stairs in this hallway and enter Room 207.  Go 
through the crack in the wall and leave the room, watch out for crazy double 
headed baby monsters.  Return to the second floor East hallway and enter Room 
203.  There's a hole in the bedroom wall, leave again and enter Room 201.  
Climb the stairs to reach Room 301, leave the room and enter your apartment.

If there are any hauntings in your room then eliminate them.  Open the chest 
and get ready to switch up some items.  Dump the Nightstick, the Sword of 
Obedience, the Saint Medallions, and such.  This is where you get ready for 
the end so stock up, but be sure to leave at least three or four spaces open, 
you won't need that much crap anyway.  As far as I'm concerned, just as guns 
weren't too useful in the game, they won't be too useful at the end, and not 
having to bring much ammo is a good thing but it's up to you.  If you've still 
got that Ampoule then bring it along, maybe with a Portable Medical kit.  The 
Rusty Axe or better yet, the Pickaxe of Despair and perhaps the Revolver with 
one set of bullets.  And of course you must bring the Umbilical Cord.  When 
you're ready then save the game and go through the hole at the end of the hall 
leading into the hidden room.  Examine the black hole and choose to go in.

If you're ready, then after the scene, jump down the hole.  It's time to take 
on the boss of the game.  Here's what you need to do, begin by running over to 
the large monstrous creature and using the Umbilical Cord, after that your 
next duty becomes clear.  There are eight spears around this area, since you 
used the Umbilical Cord you should have four open slots, go to one side of the 
monster and grab the four spears, then jam them into its body.  After doing 
this go to the left side of the huge monster and grab the other four spears, 
jamming them into its body.  Remember to be quick, as you may have noticed 
Eileen is kind of walking toward her doom.  (Note the battle does not end if 
she dies, it affects the ending.)  The best way to fight this battle is with 
the Pickaxe of Despair, no question.  Forget the guns.  After Walter has 
become human what you want to do is equip the pickaxe and start charging it.  
Something which will be very important in this battle is the sidestep.  While 
charging your axe, move left ro right and press circle to jump to the side, 
you can easily avoid Walte'rs bullets this way if you time it right.  Once the 
axe is charged, approach him.  Wait until he either starts to lift his hand to 
fire, or pull back to swing the pipe and let loose.  Since the axe is so 
powerful this is also the fastest way to kill him, so it has the highest 
chance of killing him before Eileen walks into the machine.  Good luck.

Two years ago Henry Townshend moved into Room 203, his apartment, happy to 
start a new life.  Five days ago however he began to have a recurring dream.  
Soon he made a startling discovery, he could not leave Room 302.  He wakes up 
to a room, covered in a rust coloured film, things aren't hwere he remembers 
them and the door is bolted shut.  He leaves the room and enters the living 
room to find similar oddities.  Suddenly out of the wall come a number of 
cracks as the body of some kind of creature pulls itself through the wall.  As 
this monstrous humanoid body drops to the floor, the opening credits roll.  
Henry Townshend wakes up, believing that everything which just occurred was a 
dream.  He turns around and picks up his telephone, which doesn't seem to be 
working.  As he hangs up suddenly the phone rings.  It's a woman's voice on 
the other end, she is calling out for help, but soon the voice cuts out and 
Henry realizes the phone line has been cut the whole time.  Henry leaves his 
room and moves to the front door.  It is bolted with chains, the windows are 
permanently shut too.  A notice on the inside of the door, written in red 
reads "Don't go out! - Walter."  Through the peephole he spies a woman, 
Eileen, she is his neighbor.  Henry is able to see the outside world just 
fine, he simply cannot get there.  On the wall outside his door there are 
fifteen handprints on the wall.  Henry goes back into his living room only to 
find a scrap of paper hidden behind a bookshelf, the piece of paper reads:

               "Through the Ritual of the Holy Assumption, he 
               built a world.  It exists in a space separate 
               from the world of our Lord.  More accurately, it 
               is within, yet without the Lord's world.

               Unlike the world of out Lord, it is a world in 
               extreme flux.  Unexpected doors or walls, moving 
               floors, odd creatures, a world only he can 
               control... Anyone swallowed up by that world will 
               live there for eternity, undying.  They will 
               haunt that realm as a spirit.  How can our Lord 
               forgive such an abomination...?

               (This part of the book is too damaged to read.)

               ...It is important to travel lightly in that 
               world.  He who carries too heavy a burden will 
               regret it...

               (The book is too damaged to read any more.)"

Next Henry takes a look inside the large chest nearby and hears a loud crash.  
It sounded like it came from the room beside him.  As he walks toward the room 
Henry notices a scrap of paper under the door.  It reads "Mom, Why doesn't u 
Wake up?"  He checks the room nearby but there doesn't seem to be anything 
different, perhaps the bathroom.  Henry enters the bathroom to find a large 
hole in the wall.  He pulls a Steel Pipe out which happens to be blocking the 
opening and then decides he has no choice but to go into it, there is 
absolutely no other way for him to get out of his apartment.

As the scene cuts in, Henry is sitting on an escalator moving downward.  At 
the bottom is a subway tunnel, it is not known how the hole led him here, but 
at the moment there is no way for him to escape.  After only a few steps he 
meets up with a mysterious woman.  He asks her name, and she laughs.  She 
wonders why someone in her dream wouldn't even know her name.  She thinks she 
is in a dream, why else would she be in such a place.  She introduces herself 
as Cynthia and says that if Henry helps her find the exit, perhaps she'll do 
him a special favour.  It's a dream, she may as well have some fun.  As they 
go around the corner past the washrooms suddenly Cynthia feels very sick and 
she runs into the women's lavatory.  Henry waits patiently outside until the 
door slowly creaks open, and a disgusting dog like creature with an enormous 
tongue flies out of the washroom, dead, followed by two other dog monsters 
which proceed to suck the creature's insides out.  He thrashes the creatures 
with his Steel Pipe and goes to check the women's washroom.  Cynthia is gone 
but there is a large hole in the wall.  With few other options left, Henry 
climbs into the hole.  The next thing he knows he is waking up in bed.

Henry wakes up in his room once again, like awaking from a bad dream.  When he 
goes out to his living room, to his surprise it seems like someone has moved 
the shelf in the corner.  Only when straightening it out does Henry come 
across the Pistol, lying on the floor, under the shelf.  It's a mystery as to 
how it got there.  There is also some writing in the wall, it looks like it 
was carved by an ice pick or something.  He reads the writing:

               "The faint hope I had is slowly changing to 
               despair.  I've somehow managed to tunnel this far 
               but no matter what I do, I can't get any farther.  
               The hallway, the windows, the walls... It feels 
               like this room is stuck in another dimension.  
               Eileen never noticed..."

There is a small hole in the wall that can be used to peep through into 
Eileen's apartment next door.  Henry sees Eileen but she just walks away, he 
is unable to contact her.  As he steps back from the hole he hears a phone 
ring.  It's back in his room.  The woman on the other line is Cynthia, she 
sounds like she is in a panic.  She says to hurry up and come save her, if he 
needs a token, there's one here.  Henry leaves his room only to hear another 
sound.  Looking out the peephole in his door he finds it's only Eileen, 
sweeping the floors in the hall.  The fifteen bloody handprints are still 
there.  With nothing else to do, Henry enters the hole in the bathroom again.

Henry finds himself back in the women's washroom again.  There is a bloody 
mannequin in one of the stalls, it holds the token Cynthia was talking about, 
the Lynch Steet Line Coin which allows you to move the turnstiles and get down 
into the subway.  He uses the coin for just such a purpose and goes down the 
stairs.  At the bottom, something moans and a head appears out of the wall.  
This figure pulls itself through the wall and drops to the ground before 
rising up and floating.  It's like a zombie, except not really disfigured, and 
it levitates.  These are ghosts, and they have the power to not only damage 
the body but the mind as well.  Henry feels pain just being close to these 
things and so he must always run from them.  At the bottom of the stairs there 
is Cynthia, in one of the subway cars, trapped.  Henry has to find a way to 
get her out.  Behind him he spies an odd vending machine.  The machine itself 
isn't so off but someone has painted something similar to "1&" but rather than 
that sign, it's more like the number 8 with a vertical line through it.  Henry 
finds a button in one of the subway cars that unlocks all the doors and frees 
Cynthia.  Now they must find a way to escape.  Inside the subway car, a small 
coloured box sits on the seat with "1000&" written on it.  It's locked and 
there is no way for him to open it.  They manage to weave through all the 
subway cars to the other platform.  Just as Henry walks through the door at 
the end, Cynthia disappears.  She did not follow him through the door, nor is 
she back on the other side.  Simply put, Cynthia is just gone.  Henry finds 
himself in a room, bright with red light and a large hole in the wall leading 
back to his apartment.  As he progresses further into the subway a voice comes 
over the loudspeaker.  It is Cynthia, she says she has found the exit, she 
calls for Henry to come meet her at the exit but suddenly with a scratch, her 
voice is cut off.  When Henry reaches the top he finds Cynthia's purse and all 
of her things scattered on the ground covered in blood.  Inside the room 
beside them he makes a shocking discovery.  Blood everywhere, on the ground, 
the walls and all over Cynthia who is lying on the ground barely alive.  She 
says it was all supposed to be just a dream, she feels like she's dying and 
with that, Cynthia is gone.  Carved into her chest is the number "16121."

When Henry wakes up he hears sirens.  He looks out his window to see an 
ambulance and a police car at the entrance to the subway tunnel.  Could this 
possibly have some connection with Cynthia?  He leaves the room and realizes 
his radio is on.  A voice cuts in saying to move the ambulance quickly.  THe 
same voice is heard saying "...she's got numbers carved into her chest."  It 
must be something to do with Cynthia however that's the last that is heard of 
the voice.  There is a scrap of paper stuck under Henry's door.  It reads:

               "Although the cult itself is gone, I'm sure the 
               spirit is still alive.  There are too many 
               strange things happening in that town.  I'm 
               investigating two people.  Or maybe I should say 
               just one.  I've just about discovered what's 
               going on.  

               April 8"

With nothing else left to do, Henry gets ready to enter the hole once again.  
When he gets into the bathroom he finds something is different.  The hole has 
grown in size.  Regardless of this fact, Henry climbs in to see what awaits.

Once again Henry appears sitting down, but not on an escalator.  This time he 
is sitting on a path, in a forest.  Nothing is said as he stands up and begins 
to familiarize himself with the surroundings.  As he wanders along the path 
Henry comes across a car parked, with the brakes engaged and the headlights on 
but no one in it.  He finds a note on the driver's seat that reads:

               "It's been awhile since I came here to Silent 
               Hill.  Maybe I'll meet the Devil this time.  But 
               whenever I come to a cool place like Silent Hill, 
               I always get real thirsty.  

               Jasper Gein"

That's not the only thing Henry finds, there is also another memo:

               "I'm not sure what that nosy guy meant when he 
               said: "His home is the orphanage in the middle.  
               The lake is northwest.  So the opposite is 
               southeast."  The nosy guy said one other thing I 
               don't understand: "If you bring the dug-up key, 
               you can't go back.  Put it away somewhere before 
               you return there."  

Down the path Henry finds a man sitting on a rock.  The man has a very bad 
stutter.  He says that someone else was here, something to do with an old 
native "stone" they called the Mother Stone.  They used it in some kind of 
cult ritual, something to do as well with the children from the orphanage but 
the man isn't making a lot of sense.  He mentions a ceremony for talking to 
the dead.  This man is Jasper Gein, the one who wrote the first memo.  At the 
end of the path Henry finds another hole and makes a return trip back home.

As he steps out of his room, there is a buzz at the door.  Henry walks over 
and takes a look out of his peephole.  Eileen is there.  He pounds on the door 
to try and get her attention.  Richard Braintree appears and talks to Eileen.  
She says something weird is going on in the room.  Richard says it's probably 
nothing and asks Eileen if she knows the person who lives in there (Henry) 
very well.  She says she only knows his name and face.  Ricahrd tells her he 
will go and call the super.  With that, Henry goes back thorugh the hole.

Back in the forest world again Henry goes past the orphanage to reach the 
cliff overlooking Toluca Lake, something you may be familiar with from 
previous Silent Hill games.  There is nothing on interest here besides the 
lake so Henry finds a different path and soon, a young boy.  He asks the 
little boy what he is doing here, but the boy doesn't respond.  Jasper appears 
from behind saying it's going to happen, it's finally going to happen!  THe 
little boy runs off and Jasper is gone too.  Henry finds himself in a 
cemetery, he looks down at a coffin in an open grave.  The numbers "11121" are 
written on the bottom of the coffin.  On the South side of the cemetery is a 
door, on the door is a symbol.  This is the cult symbol from Silent Hill 3, 
the same symbol in fact that was used as the save points in that game.  
Finally Henry returns to check out the orphanage (Wish House), Jasper is out 
front saying that no one can go inside.  He says the nosy guy gave him 
something really good, but he won't give it away from free, he's soooo 
thirsty.  Henry offers him the Chocolate Milk he had in from the fridge back 
in his apartment.  In return Jasper gives Henry the Blood-Inscribed Spade:

               "Opposite where the lake and house meet, inside
               the hand holding onto the ground."

This is what is written on the spade.  Henry takes the spade and follows the 
path leading to a large tree.  Not just any tree, the roots of this tree are 
protruding out of the ground in the shape of hands reaching up.  He digs here 
using the spade and discovers the Rusted Bloody Key.  The description of the 
key reads that the holder will "wander for eternity" and it is correct.  Henry 
has no way to return to the Wish House, when he tries to run back, the fog 
thickens and the path loops forever.  The note he picked up in the car said 
that you can't go anywhere with the dug up key, you have to put it somewhere.  
The solution is for Henry to return to his apartment and store it there.

Doing so allows Henry to bring the key back when he reaches the Wish House and 
get inside.  The whole place has been broken down pretty bad, tables, chairs 
and shelves lie tipped in all directions.  He finds a note on the ground:

               "Have you found Alessa yet?  How is Walter's 
               progress coming along?  Send me a report."

Over in the back corner there is another memo on the ground beside the door:

               "The Second Sign
               And God said,

               Offer the Blood of the Ten Sinners
               and the White Oil.

               Be then released from the bonds of the flesh, and 
               gain the Power of Heaven.  From the Darkness and 
               Void, bring forth Gloom, and gird thyself with 
               Despair for the Giver of Wisdom.

               The Third Sign
               And God said,
               Return to the Source through sin's Temptation.  
               Under the Watchful eye of the demon, wander alone 
               in the formless Chaos.  Only then will the Four 
               Atonements be in alignment."

Once the note has been read Henry hears crying coming from the door beside 
him.  Smoke pours through the crack as he goes toward it.  Another placard, 
the Source Placard sits in the door.  It's very similar to the Temptation 
Placard he found just before discovering Cynthia's body.  Inside the room 
there is Jasper, holding something to his hand while his entire body is up in 
flames.  The door shuts behind Henry and Jasper says he finally saw him, the 
one the nosy guy was talking about... the devil, and he falls to the floor.

Once again Henry wakes up in his bedroom.  A voice is heard, less like a radio 
transmission and more like a news report.  It is a woman's voice.  She says a 
body was found burned to death in a forest near Silent Hill, the body of a 
thirty year old male.  It has been ruled a homicide due to the ritualistic 
carving of the numbers "17121" in the man's body.  They are also considering a 
possible link to the Walter Sullivan case from ten years ago.  Henry leaves 
his room and hears a buzz at the door.  It's the superintendent, Frank 
Sunderland (James Sunderland was the main character in Silent Hill 2, Frank 
Sunderland is supposed to be his father.)  He tries to get the door open but 
the key doesn't work.  He thinks he hears a noise, and then says something it 
"it's the just like back then" as if this has happened before.  Afterward, he 
wanders away.  On the wall outside his room, there are seventeen bloody 
handprints.  There were fiteen when the game began, sixteen after Cynthia died 
and now seventeen after the death of Jasper.  Henry wanders into the bathroom 
and takes a look at the hole, it has grown once again.  He climbs inside.

Henry sits up in the round hallway of some kind of prison.  There is a man 
constantly screaming "get me out of here" somewhere on this floor.  In the 
hall there is a memo laying on the ground, he picks it up and reads:

               "Lucky!  I finally escaped from the cell.  I 
               decided to take a careful look around this 
               building.  The scariest place was the 1st floor 
               basement.  There's a kitchen in the northeast, 
               but next door in the northwest is a death 
               chamber.  To get in there, you have to punch in 
               the right numbers.  I don't know the numbers, and 
               it was too dark to even see the panel, so I 
               didn't go in."

The man who is crying out is inside one of the cells, it's locked and there is 
no way to open it even from the outside.  He's saying they're going to kill 
him, but nothing can be done right now.  Henry enters one of the unlocked 
cells.  There is a noose hanging down from the ceiling and a note that says 
"I'm sick of being watched."  A peephole is located at the top that seems to 
suggest people could be looking in on the prisoners whenever they wanted.  
Footsteps are heard from above and a shadow passes by when the footsteps are 
right overhead.  Another room has written on the wall "I'm being watched from 
the middle room."  Henry comments that it looks like a child's writing.  
At the bottom of the long stairs outside, Henry finds the following message:

               "To turn on the lights in the 3rd floor cells, 
               turn the waterwheel.  Remember that the water 
               must flow in the direction of the waterwheel.  Of 
               course, you also have to open the sluice gate on 
               the roof."

Now Henry decides that it is time to return back to his apartment again.

The television has been turned on in Henry's apartment but he never turned it 
on.  He is also unable to turn it off no matter what he tries.  Along with 
this oddity, another note has been slipped under the door.  It reads:

               "Lately I've been feeling like my life is in 
               serious danger.  I've been through a lot in my 
               life, but I've never felt this kind of pure, 
               animal fear.  In case something happens to me, 
               I've decided to write down what I've learned for 
               whoever you are that is living in the apartment 
               now.  I've been investigating the mass murder 
               that took place 7 years ago in which 10 people 
               were killed in 10 days.  They were killed in a 
               variety of ways, but one thing that had in common 
               was that each corpse had the following numbers, 
               in order of their deaths, carved into them:

               01121, 02121, 03121,
               04121, 05121, 06121,
               07121, 08121, 09121,
               10121 ... The name of thier killer...
               it was carved in as well...

               His name was...Walter Sullivan.

               April 4"

This is beginning to shed some kight on the subject, Henry has already come 
into contact with the nameWalter numerous times and victims with numbers 
carved into them.  Cynthia had the number "16121" carved, Jasper had "17121" 
in his body and on the bottom of the coffin was "11121."  With nothing else of 
interest going on in the apartment, Henry climbs back into the hole again.

+-- /  | ATER PRISON WORLD - PLOT SUMMARY --------------------------- 2.12 --+

Back in the prison world Henry makes it to another cell block.  In one of the 
rooms there is a diary sitting on the table, it reads as follows:

               "I've been watching the surveillance room's 
               peephole the whole time, and sometimes he's 
               there.  I can tell 'cause I see a shadow move or 
               hear his footsteps."

The more rooms he explores the more diaries he finds.  Two more from one cell:

               "I'm in trouble.  I stood in front of the 
               surveillance room and yelled as loud as I would, 
               but nobody came out."

               "We had beef stew yesterday.  In the cafeteria, I 
               heard there's a death chamber behind the kitchen, 
               and they take meat straight from the dead people 
               and cook it.  That really scared me."

Some of the rooms have large holes in the centre, the purpose of which isn't 
exactly clear, perhaps for throwing bodies down.  Henry jumps down to reach 
the shower room in the basement.  From there it's a short climb to the 
surveillance room.  A memo sits on the desk in there, he reads it:

               "This place continues to deteriorate.  The doors 
               to a number of cells no longer open.  As a 
               result, the kids inside can no longer go outside.  
               But the less they know about that, the better.  I 
               can't open the doors, but from this room I can 
               watch them get more and more emaciated each day.  
               With no food and never showering themselves, they 
               turns into smelly little grey lumps in there.  
               Following the suggestion of an engineer, we've 
               disposed of the corpses by digging a hole below 
               the cells.  Since each floor of this building can 
               be rotated independently, we can dispose of the 
               bodies without the others noticing by aligning 
               each cell with a body in it vertically.  

               P.S. Chief, I bet you're just dying to see the 
               interrogation room behind the kitchen.  I 
               understand your feelings, but have you noticed?  
               There are three rooms with bloody beds.  One is 
               on the 1st floor, one is on the 2nd floor, and 
               one is on the 3rd floor.  If you line those three 
               rooms up, then it's "bingo.""

On the second floor surveillance room there is another document there.

               "To keep a close eye on the kids, it's important 
               to keep the cells well lit.  The lights on the 
               3rd floor were originally bought as searchlights.  
               As a precaution against blackout, they were set 
               up to run on a private generator.  There's a 
               hydroelectric generator in the basement.  To 
               light up the 1st and 2nd floors, use the corpse 
               disposal chutes.  Since each floor of this 
               building can be rotated, you can light up any of 
               the cells by matching up the holes.  Repeating 
               this periodically is an effective way to keep the 
               kids fearful and well behaved.

               P.S. - Chief, if you turn the handle in the 
               middle of this room, you can easily rotate the 
               cells.  You can't rotate the 1st floor, so align 
               the 2nd and 3rd floors with the 1st floor cell 
               that has the blood-stained bed.  By the way, if 
               you use the peephole in this room, it's easy to 
               make sure you're doing it right.  Give it a try.  
               Also, please don't forget to open the sluice gate 
               on the roof.  Much appreciated, Chief!"

Henry turns the handle that rotates the cells once, and the door to the cell 
with the man in it, on the first floor, opens.  The man is now free.  Henry 
climbs down to the basement where he finds the man speaking with the child, 
but the child walks away without saying anything.  Henry asks the man who that 
child is, the man says the child's name is Walter... Walter Sullivan  THe man 
says he used to work at the orphanage watching over the children, but it was 
only called an orphanage as a cover, it was actually the centre of the 
religion.  Walter was really into that kind of stuff, especially the descent 
of the holy mother.  The man introduces himself as Andrew DeSalvo and then 
wanders off alone.  Henry goes off to align the cells with the bloody beds and 
finally illuminate the panel in the kitchen, leading to the supposed death 
chamber behind it.  The code works and he finds himself in the death chamber 
which really lives up to its name.  Buzzsaws hang on the walls, and Andrew 
DeSalvo, lies in a pool of green muck with the number "18121" carved in his 
chest.  Nothing is said as everything slowly fades away and he wakes up again.

There is a noise in the apartment, coming from the bathroom.  Henry goes to 
investigate and finds his bathtub, totally covered in blood.  Screams can also 
be heard in the distance.  He leaves the bathroom and heads for the front 
door.  Outside the peephole Eileen and Frank Sunderland are there.  Frank says 
he tried to open the door but something's blocking it from the inside.  This 
isn't the first time it's happened either, and not just the guy who lived here 
before.  Everyone who has ever lived in this apartment.  He slips a note under 
the door and they wander off.  Eighteen bloody handprints now reside on the 
wall.  Henry looks down, the superintendent's memo is too stained with blood 
to even be able to read.  Another memo has been pushed under as well:

               "I've found something that's extremely effective 
               against the ghosts.  It saved my life.  It was 
               stuck into the huge rock in the woods near the 
               orphanage.  It's a sword blade with a hand-made, 
               triangle-shaped wooden handle that has some kind 
               of spell written on it.  As a weapon, it's heavy 
               and hard to carry.  But somehow it seems to 
               change in response to the ghost-victim's power.  
               Strike when the sword is energized!  If you don't 
               reduce their power, your attacks will be 
               repelled.  As far as I know, there are only 5 
               swords in existence with that kind of power.  
               It's extremely valuable.

               July 23"

That's all that is new in the apartment, Henry ventures back into the hole.

Henry wakes up on the ground in an alleyway between two buildings.  Down at 
the bottom of the stairs he comes across Richard Braintree, the guy who lives 
across the hall.  He asks what's going on, something about the hole and this 
freaky world.  He says that if Henry is here too it must be a problem with the 
whole apartment building.  It must be the same thing that happened to the 
other guy, the guy who lived in 203 before Henry.  He was a journalist or 
something, he got a little crazy toward the end and shut himself up in his 
room.  Anyway, Richard says to be careful, he's going to go find the exit.  
Just as he leaves, Henry awkwardly tells him to watch out for "that kid."  
Soon enough Henry finds yet another hole that takes him back to his apartment, 
but something is odd.  There is a knock at the door.  When he goes to check it 
out, the words "BETTER CHECK ON YOUR NEIGHBOR SOON!" are written on the wall 
in blood.  When Henry looks through the peephole in the wall he sees Eileen in 
her room, almost like she's in pain from something out of sight, perhaps more 
like an annoyance that pain, there is a creepy noise everytime she is 
irritated.  Back in the Building World, Richard is speaking with the little 
boy in an elevator, waving his gun.  The boy looks kind fo scared.  Richard 
asks the kid if he knows what's going on.  He says the kid looks familiar, 
like some punk he caught sneaking aorund once.  After that the kid runs off 
and the scene shifts back to Henry.  Soon enough Henry reaches the Bar 
Southfield down at the bottom where he comes across a memo:

               "The boss said that the numder this time is the 
               last 4 digits of this store's phone number.  But 
               the phone number is written right there on the 
               sign on the roof.  Anybody could see it from 
               South Ashfield Street.  It that really okay?"

For those just tuning in, Henry Townshend's house is on South Ashfield Street.  
So with that he climbs into the hole and takes a trip back home.  He sees the 
phone number through his window and returns to input the code.  There is a 
large spiraling staircase area which leads up to a door at the top.  A scream 
is heard.  The door in number 207, the same door from the apartment, the same 
room that Richard Braintree lives in.  Henry finds yet another Placard on the 
door and enters the room.  Richard Braintree is indeed in there, sitting on an 
electric chair.  The young boy stands calmly beside him.  Richard barely 
manages to say "that's... no... kid... it's... the... 11121... man" before he 
dies.  Everythign fades and yet again, Henry wakes up in his apartment.

Henry looks out his window, back in the apartment.  There is a man in room 
207, Richard's room, pointing out the window at room 303, Eileen's room.  When 
he leaves the room there is another kind of radio sound and a voice.  Someone 
is talking about the murder of Richard, saying that it's the numbers carved 
into the body again.  The number "19121" was carved into Richard.  The man on 
the transmission says it's just like the case ten years ago, the Walter 
Sullivan case, but he's dead and they even have the body.  Must be some crazy 
copycat.  Henry enters the bathroom once more, and proceeds into the hole.

Henry wakes up in his apartment, but things are not normal, the walls are red 
as if covered in blood, and the floors are made of a metal mesh.  Eileen is 
there as well as a mysterious man knocking on her door, room 303.  Henry 
begins by going into room 301 where he finds a diary sitting on the table:

               "The last few months, Joseph, the guy next door 
               to me who gave me that rare porn magazine, looks 
               like he's been working super hard.  He said he 
               found another rare one, he'd give it to me but he 
               hasn't shown his face around much lately.  He 
               said he was a journalist and he is always 
               investigating stuff.  But I think something 
               strange is going on with him.  He's been shut in 
               his apartment and I can hear all these weird 
               noises coming from there.

               July 1 - Mike

               Oh my beautiful Rachael, What's with the note on 
               the red paper?  I thought you'd written a note 
               back to me... But I guess maybe it was somewhere 
               else... He took it along with my clothes.  Those 
               were my best clothes.

               July 2 - Mike"

Beside the diary is a piece of red paper with nothing written on it.  Henry 
decides that he will stick it under room 302's door (his room.)  In the 
bedroom Henry finds a magazine article lying on the bed there:

               "Teaching Despair: "Wish House"

               "Wish House," an orphanage on the outskirts of 
               Silent Hill.  But behind its false image is a 
               place where children are kidnapped and 
               brainwashed.  Wish House is managed by the 
               "Silent Hill Smile Support Society," a charity 
               organization sometimes called "4S."  It's true 
               that 4S is a well-respected charity that "takes 
               in poor children without homes and raises them 
               with hope."  But at its heart, it is a heathen 
               organization that teaches its own warped dogma in 
               lieu of good religious values.  Mr. Smith (temp), 
               who lives near "Wish House," had this to say: 
               "Sometimes at night I can hear their weird 
               prayers and the sounds of [children] crying.  I 
               went there to complain one time, but they ran me 
               right out.  Since then, it hasn't changed a 
               bit."  In fact, this reporter was refused 
               admission when he attempted to take photographs 
               in the facility.  What exactly do the folks at 
               "Wish House" have to hide?  During my 
               investigations, I was able to discover, however, 
               a suspicious-looking round concrete tower which 
               appears to be part of their facilities.  
               Unfortunately no one was willing to tell us what 
               the tower was used for.  But it seems unlikely 
               that is has anything to do with the business of 
               raising orphans.  It may in fact be a prison, or 
               a secret place of worship.  The cult religion 
               that operates "Wish House" is known by the locals 
               simply as "The Order."  It's a religion that is 
               deeply interwoven with Silent Hill's history.  
               But its worshippers' fervent belief that they are 
               among the elite "chosen people" has a dark and 
               dangerous side.  I intend to contine my 
               investigation of "Wish House" and the cult behind 
               it.  I've always believed that "telling the whole 
               truth" and showing the children the true path, is 
               out most important duty.  

               Joseph Schreiber"

After picking up a couple of keys Henry heads for his own room.  In the 
distance he can see the young child, the one who is supposedly Walter 
Sullivan, banging on his door.  As he approaches the child disappears.  There 
is a red piece of paper under his door,  He places his piece of red paper 
under there as well.  In the next room, the long haired man who was knocking 
on Eileen's door is sitting on the stairs and holding a doll.  He says that 
miss Galvin (Eileen) gave it to him, she was younger than him back then.  He 
offers it to Henry, who is free to take it if he wants.  Down at the bottom of 
the stairs are a number of lockers, Henry uses the key that he found to open 
one and a number of letters fall out.  All of them are love letters, from Mike 
to Rachael.  Henry decides now to go back through the hole to his apartment.  
Two red pieces of paper are stuck under his door just like he saw before:

               "It was four years ago that they discovered the 
               body with "12/21" carved into it.  Right away I 
               had this terrible feeling and couldn't stop 
               shaking.  The victim had been murdered six months 
               earlier, but Walter had been dead for seven 
               years, having committed suicide three years 
               before the murder.  The police think it's a 
               copycat crime and are calling it the Sullivan 
               Case Round Two.  But something about it bothered 
               me...

               May 14"

               "I figured out the riddle behind the numbers.  
               "01121" is actually "01/21."  In other words, 1 
               out of 21.  So Walter was planning on killing 21 
               people...?  But he never finished the job.  He 
               was convicted for the murders of Billy and Miriam 
               Locane, the 7th and 8th victims.  Afterwards, he 
               committed suicide in his jail cell.  The grisly 
               mass murder of 10 people shocked the world and 
               came to be known as the "Walter Sullivan Case."  
               There are two big puzzles here.  The first is: 
               What was the motive for the murders?  The second 
               is: Why did he kill himself before completing his 
               task?  Was he simply insane...?

               May 2"

Looking out the peephole Henry sees the long haired man staring back through 
the peephole at him, until the man walks away.  There are a total of nineteen 
bloody handprints on the wall.  Back in the hole again, Henry finds the 
superintendent's room.  There is a diary on his bedside table that reads:

               "The red box seems even stranger today.  It's 
               giving off a terrible smell.  It's disgusting, 
               but I just can't throw it away.  It must have 
               been around 30 years ago.  That young couple was 
               living in the apartment, but one day they just 
               suddenly disappeared.  Ran off just like thieves 
               in the night.  I don't know why.  It must have 
               been money troubles, or maybe they got themselves 
               into some kind of danger.  The problem came after 
               that.  They left their newborn baby when they 
               took off.  I even found the umbilical cord.  I 
               called the ambulance right away and I heard the 
               baby survived, but I don't know what happened to 
               him.  Although a few years later, I often saw a 
               young kid hanging around the apartment.  One day 
               he just stopped coming by.  But now that I think 
               of it, I'll be he was that abandoned baby.  It's 
               a horrible story.  Abandoning a newborn baby... 
               That all happened in Room 302... And the 
               umbilical cord I found there... Well I still 
               can't get myself to throw it away."

Henry comes across Riachard Braintree's room as well.  The electric chair 
where Richard died is there, and the revolver he was carrying is sitting on 
the chair.  With nothing else to check out, Henry crams all the red paper 
under his door in the Apartment world and returns to his real Apartment.  
There are now four pieces or red paper and torn red paper under the door:

               "Rachael...
               ...love you...always
               watching...window...
               ...protect you...ith love,
               Mike"

               "I lost the key to Eileen Galvin's room.  I've 
               gotta find it and bring it back.  Let me think... 
               The last place I saw it was..."

               "Oh yeah, I had a really wicked headache that day 
               and just collapsed on the bed.  Maybe if I look 
               near the bed in my room -302's bedroom- I'll find 
               it.  I get headaches every day now.  It's 
               terrible.  What am I going to do?

               May 22"

               "I picked up the key that Eileen from Room 303 
               must have dropped.  I thought I'd return it but 
               she wasn't home.  I guess I'll give it to the 
               super.  

               May 20"

In his room, like the letter describes, Henry finds the Doll Key, the key to 
Eileen Galvin's room, Room 303.  In the Apartment World again, Henry uses the 
key to open Eileen's door and hears a scream.  Inside the little boy is there 
and Eileen is on the floor, bloody, with the number "20/21" carved into her 
back.  She says "thanks" to the kid and asks "did you ever find your mommy?" 
before collapsing on the ground.  Henry wakes up in his room to hear sirens.

Through the window Henry sees an ambulane pulling out of the apartment parking 
lot, presumably with Eileen.  Looking through the peephole in the wall into 
Eileen's room you can hear a conversation between two cops.  They are talking 
about Eileen's murder, saying she's not going to make it.  They call it the 
Walter Sullivan Case Round Three, but since they never caught the guy behind 
Round Two it could be the same one, or perhaps, the same guy for all three.  
The pink bunny (Silent Hill 3) sitting in Eileen's room now faces the 
peephole, rather than away from it.  Under the door there are two things, one 
piece of red paper and another thing.  The piece of red paper reads:

               "I don't think I can protect myself.  He's truly 
               insane.  I can'thold on any longer.  His power 
               can't be measured.  I was so scared today that I 
               sealed off the back of the storage room.  I 
               wonder if Eileen Galvin is okay.  She has no idea 
               what's going on... But she's in danger 
               nevertheless.

               July 13"

The other object under the door was something called the Succubus Talisman.  
The hole in the bathroom has been totally covered over.  Henry finds in his 
laundry room, some weird image on the wall.  With the power of the Succubus 
Talisman it turns into four indentations and some writing in red:

               "After he did the Ritual of the Holy Assumption, 
               other worlds began to force their way into his 
               universe and it began to swell horribly.  But his 
               universe is different than ours -- it has limits.  
               And in the limits of that universe, he rules as a 
               king.  And in the deepest part of his kingdom is 
               his Mother."

This causes four indentations to appear, each labelled with names that match 
those of the placards Henry found before each of the corpses.  Placing them 
into the wall, a new hole appears in the laundry room of his apartment.

Henry wakes up in some kind of hospital room.  The long haired man is there 
covered in blood with his hands inside the cut open chest of a woman, white as 
a ghost all over her body.  He quickly runs out of the room before the man can 
do anything.  He finds Eileen's handbag lying on the ground, and in the 
reception room there is a large whiteboard with X-rays and photographs of 
Eileen's many injuries.  There's also a nurse's memo sitting on the table:

               "I lost Eileen Galvin's hospital room key.  She 
               was a patient brought in with severe injuries.  I 
               wonder if I left it in one of the other gospital 
               rooms.  I really hope not..."

Upstairs in one of the rooms, Henry finds Eileen.  She seems to have survived 
the attack, her arm is broken and the numbers are still carved into her back, 
just more faint.  He explains to her that he found this hole in his apartment 
and he saw people getting killed in weird worlds, including her.  There was a 
child with her.  She says she remembers now, the child saved her from the man 
with the coat, she was getting ready to go to a party.  She asks Henry to take 
her with him.  They go back down to the first floor and enter the hole.

Henry wakes up in his apartment and something feels odd.  Eileen has not come 
with him, and the air seems somewhat heavier.  In game terms, at this point 
Henry is no longer healed automatically when he comes back to the apartment.  
He walks out into the living room, the ceiling fan is now broken and lying 
against the coffee table, it has fallen down.  There is also a red envelope 
under his door with a key and a note written on it:

               "You've seen that horrible world as well... That 
               horrible nightmare.  But if you get sucked into 
               it, it's not just a nightmare.  Don't get lost in 
               there.  If you get pulled in, you'll be killed.  
               But there's still hope.  Maybe this small key 
               will guide you.  If you've seen the door with the 
               placard set in it, look on the other side of the 
               door.  Then keep going down.  To the deepest part 
               of him.  And look for the ultimate Truth.

               July 20 - Joseph"

Three more pieces of red paper sit behind Henry's bookshelf.  They read:

               "Walter Sullivan did kill himself.  He died in 
               his prison cell of blood loss after he stabbed 
               himself in the neck with a spoon.  His body was 
               buried in a cemetery just outside his hometown of 
               Silent Hill in an unmarked grave.  After that, 
               his name became famous all over the world and it 
               looked like his string of mass murders was 
               finished at 10 out of 21.  But 3 years later, 
               they found a corpse that had "12/21" carved into 
               it.  The corpse was from six months earlier.  In 
               other words, the person was killed two and a half 
               years after Sullivan committed suicide.  The MO 
               was exactly the same as Sullivan's.  Except for 
               one thing.  All 10 of SuUllivan's victims were 
               found with their hearts cut out and their chest 
               wounds sewn together expertly with thread.  On 
               the other hand, the "12/21" victim still had 
               their heart.  Naturally the police think it's a 
               copy cat and are proceeding on that basis.  But 
               they haven't made any progress and recently 
               discovered victim number 13.  This corpse also 
               had their heart intact.  The police still havn't 
               even identified a suspect.  I've got a working 
               hypothesis.  Very few people knew the details of 
               the original crimes and would be able to copy 
               Sullivan's MO so precisely.  First I'll head to 
               Silent Hill... To the graveyard near that 
               beautiful little lake.  Maybe I'll find the 
               answer there.  

               June 11"

               "How long has it been since I left this room?  I 
               can't tell if it's been days or hours... But 
               during that time they've found the body of 
               "14/21."  I've been having hallucinations lately.  
               I think I'm losing my mind.  

               (No date written)."

               "The weather that day was very strange.  Even 
               though I avoided the earlier storm, there was 
               still a thick fog clinging to everything.  
               Fortunately, that allowed me to avoid being seen 
               and get right to work.  The police are still 
               stubbornly acting as if it's just a copycat case.  
               So I figured things probably hadn't been touched 
               here.  But I was wrong.  I should have come 
               sooner.  The cemetery was in such bad condition 
               that it was almost sad.  The storm must have 
               raised the sea level.  Anywaym that's how it was 
               when I found Walter Sullivan's grave.  

               (The diary is pretty damaged around this point 
               and I can't read anymore...)

               I'm still in shock... There was no body in the 
               grave... And on top of that, written on the 
               coffin were the numbers "11/21"...

               June 14"

With that Henry goes back into the laundry room and proceeds through the hole.

Eileen is in the room when Henry returns.  She says he just disappeared, she 
never saw any hole.  Henry says he might know how to save them.  He asks if 
she knows a guy named Joseph.  Eileen says it was the man who lived in Henry's 
apartment befor ehim but he disappeared six months earlier.  Henry says he 
heard from Jospeh that you have to go down to the "deepest part of him" and 
suggest "let's do that" as if it's something you can just, do.  Regardless 
they head through the hospital and find a door that leads outdoors to an odd 
spiraling walkway.  The door at the bomottom of the walkway has the odd 
religious symbol on it, and it leads back to the Subway World once again.

Arriving back at the apartment Henry begins to experience the hauntings.  
There are ghastly forces similar to the ghost victims in the evil world that 
damage Henry unless he wards them off with the medallion of special candles.  
Along with the lack of a regenerative effect now, his apartment is becoming 
less and less appealing.  Under the door there is an envelope with a toy key 
inside of it and a piece of red paper.  They both read respectively:

               "Mommy, I'll giv you this so pleez wake up soon.  
               It's inside my toy train."

               "I've found two mysterious and powerful artifacts 
               that seem to be effective for evading the ghost-
               victims: the Holy Candles and the Saint 
               Medallion.  Not only are they effective against 
               the ghost-victims in the Other World, they also 
               seem to prevent them from invading my room.  Just 
               light the candle near where they're coming in and 
               its holy power is activated.  The Saint Medallion 
               seems to repel unholy energy when it's worn 
               (equipped).  I'm starting to gain some hope.

Henry picks up the Toy Key and keeps it with him as he re-enters the hole.

Arriving back in the Subway World, at the turnstile, something happens.  The 
body of Cynthia, although somewhat less recognizable, is laying on the ground 
on the other side of the turnstile.  It begins to levitate and phase through 
the bars, this is her ghost and Henry has to fight it.  With the poer of one 
of those special swords Joseph wrote about he is able to pin Cynthia's ghost 
to the ground.  He moves down into the subway area for a second time.  WHen 
Henry comes across a ladder, Eileen chooses to remain at the top since her arm 
is broken.  Soon after Henry takes another hole back ot his apartment.  Under 
his front door there is yet another piece of red paper stuck there:

               "A few days after Walter killed himself in his 
               cell, several residents witnessed a long-haired 
               man with a coat here.  Through his window, 
               Richard Braintree in 207 saw the man moving 
               something heavy and doing something in Room 302.  
               Even Sunderland, the superintendent, saw the man 
               with the coat hanging around Room 302, and 
               confirmed there were signs someone had been in 
               there.  

               July 17"

Back in the Subway World again, Henry and Eileen get hold of a key that allows 
them into the room where Cynthia was murdered.  There's blood everywhere but 
the only object of note is a Train Handle.  They use it to move a train 
forward and reveal a hidden path.  Through the door, there is a hazy ivison of 
the long haired man in the coat.  He says nothing as he holds his gun up and 
runs toward Henry and Eileen, trying to shoot them and hit them with the pipe.  
The only thing they can do is run through the door.  The door takes them to 
the odd walkway, the same one that connected the Hospital World to the second 
Subway World.  Well this time is connects them to the second Forest World.

The man with the long hair and coat follow them into this world, still 
attacking.  Once they reach the Wish House however he disappears, or at least, 
what remains of the Wish House.  It seems when Jasper burned down, the house 
burned with him.  There is a memo lying on the ground in the house's remains:

               "Something's here but nothing's here.
               I feel something evil from the well.
               Something's missing...
               Aaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!
               It has begun!!!

               Jasper"

A wheelchair sits also in the remains with the torso of a doll, it reads:

               "Though my body may be destroyed, I will not let 
               you pass here.  To prepare for the Receiver of 
               Wisdom... I cut my body into five pieces and hid 
               them in the darkness."

With nothing else to do Henry returns through the hole back to his apartment 
again.  Under the front door, someone has slipped another piece of red paper:

               "My theory is that Walter never died at the 
               prison.  It may have been someone else who 
               committed suicide.  Either that, or the person 
               the police arrested was not the real Walter 
               Sullivan.  I'm in no position to investigate what 
               really happened at the prison, but in any case, 
               Walter didn't die at the prison.  The man with 
               the coat that showed up here was the real Walter.  
               7 years ago, he did something in that apartment.  
               I'm certain there's a link between that and the 
               bizarre things that have been happening here.  
               Just a little bit more and I'll have this whole 
               thing figured out.  I may even find that the real 
               Walter is somewhere nearby...

               July 18"

That's all to do in the apartment, Henry once again returns to the Forest 
world.  At the cliff that overlooks the lake, Henry finds the young child.  
Henry asks if his name is really Walter Sullivan, and he says that's what 
everyone calls him.  His parents left after he was born, but soon he will get 
to see his mother again, it's written in the Scriptures, she's waiting where 
he was born and he has to go.  Henry goes back to the Wish House after 
collecting all the pieces of the doll which was blocking the stairs down into 
the basement.  The basement is full of religious items, including a book:

               "The Descent of the Holy Mother
               -- The 21 Sacraments"

               The First Sign
               And God said,
               At the time of fullness, cleanse the world with 
               my rage.  Gather forth the White Oil, the Black 
               Cup, and the Blood of the Ten Sinners.  Prepare 
               for the Ritual of the Holy Assumption.  

               The Second Sign
               And God said,
               Offer the Blood of the Ten Sinners and the White 
               Oil.Be then released from the bonds of the flash, 
               and gain the Power fo Heaven.  From the Darkness 
               and Void, bring forth Gloom, and gird thyself 
               with Despair for the Giver of Wisdom.  

               The Third Sign,
               And God said,
               Return to the Source through sin's Temptation.  
               Under the Watchful eye of the demon, wander alone 
               in the formless Chaos.  Only then will the Four 
               Atonements be in alignment.

               The Last Sign,
               And God said, separate from the flesh too, she 
               who is the Mother Reborn and he who is the 
               Receiver of Wisdom.  If this be done, by the 
               Mother of the 21 Sacraments, the Mother shall be 
               reborn and the Nation of Sin shall be redeemed."

The long haired man with the coat has followed them here as well, it seems he 
won't back off.  Henry leaves Eileen as he jumps down one of the corpse chutes 
in the cells.  There is a prisoner's shirt in the death chamber where Andrew 
DeSalvo was killed, something is written on it but it cannot be read.  When 
Henry returns to his apartment and washes it in the blood from his bathtub, 
the colour of the blood reveals the hidden message written on the back:

               "My room is on the 2nd floor and I had to drink 
               something with black things in it.  I hid the 
               sword with the triangle handle under my bed.  
               That guy, the fat one, took the basement key.  
               Next time I'll stick this triangle sword into 
               that pig and take the key."

Another scrap of red paper has been puched under the door, it reads:

               "I'm going to summarize everything that I've 
               learned about Walter Sullivan so far.  

               He was born right here in Room 302 of "South 
               Ashfield Heights."  His parents abandoned him 
               soon afterwards and disappeared somewhere, 
               leaving the baby alone.  He was discovered and 
               sent to St. Jerome's Hospital.  He was "adopted" 
               by "Wish House," an orphanage in the forest near 
               Silent Hill that's run by the secret Silent Hill 
               religious cult.  When he was six years old, 
               someone from the cult showed him where he was 
               born.  Since then, he started to believe that 
               Room 302 itself -- in other words, this room -- 
               was his mother.  Every week, he travelled from 
               the orphanage to South Ashfield Heights, a pretty 
               long trip for a kid his age.  Sometimes he took 
               the subway, and sometimes the bus.

In the Water Prison World, Henry comes into contact with Andre DeSalvo's 
ghost, just like he did with Jasper's ghost in the forest world and Cynthia's 
ghost in the Subway World.  After defeating Andrew and pinning him with a 
Sword of Obedience Henry finds the door to the next world, the Building World.

Immediately as they enter the building world, the ghost of Richard Braintree 
appears.  There is a diary on the ground which Henry takes the time to read:

               "I want to go back to that time...
               Things were so good then..."
               The day of my birthday...
               The cute cat in the pet store...
               All those balls in the basket...
               Playing pool was fun too...
               The door of time was wide open...
               When I see four things,
               I can't help bu remember that time..."

After defeating the ghost, down at the end of the alley Henry finds the man in 
the coat and the child.  The child tells the man to move, he's in the way for 
the boy going to see his mother.  The man in the coat says his name is Walter 
Sullivan, and it's time to complete the 21 Sacraments.  He grabs the boy and 
takes him away.  Henry makes his way back to that bar again and finds a memo:

               "The boss said we had to change our phone number 
               'cause of all the complains about the weird 
               noises.  Now we have to change the store sign on 
               the roof.  What a pain.  By the way, the number 
               is the last 4 digits of the new phone number.  
               Not too smart if you ask me..."

In Henry's apartment once again there is a piece of red paper under the door:

               "Continuing from yesterday, I'm going to 
               summarize everything that I've learned about 
               Walter Sullivan so far.

               Naturally, it was a long way for a kid his age to 
               travel, but he made the trip every week by subway 
               or bus.  Unfortunately, someone else was living 
               in this apartment and so he couldn't be reunited 
               with his mother (Room 302).  For years, he 
               continued to come here almost like he was 
               possessed, just to peek into the apartment.  
               Eventually, the tenants began to complain and 
               treat him badly when they saw him hanging around.  
               Walter began to fear the tenants and see them as 
               obstacles preventing him from seeing his mother.  
               As the years passed and Walter matured, he began 
               to be more and more influenced by the teachings 
               of the cult.  Furthermore, his obsession with his 
               mother and his feelings of resentment towards the 
               outer world became even deeper.  Walter became 
               preoccupied with one particular tract from the 
               cult's "Bible."  "The Descent of the Holy Mother 
               -- The 21 Sacraments" "By the 21 Sacraments, the 
               Holy Mother shall appear in the countries of the 
               world and shall bring salvation to the sinful 
               ones."  After Walter left Wish House, he moved to 
               Pleasant River, a town neighboring Silent Hill.  
               For a while, he lived the life of a normal 
               student, but he was still filled with bitterness 
               and resentment towards the rest of the world.  
               Several years later, he launched his plan there.  
               The 21 murders...

               July 29"

The the Building World there is a room, with monsters on the walls, which 
slide up and down.  A locked door poses the following riddle:

               "To reach the deepest part, you must defeat the 
               One Truth.  Do so and this door will open."

The one truth happens to be the one creature which is real, while the other 
ones are not.  Through the door is another spiral staircase leading down, but 
this time it leads right to Room 302.  Outside is a memo on the ground:

               "I had that weird dream today.  The one with the 
               man with the long hair and coat.  He was crying 
               and looking for his mother again.  I saw that man 
               with the coat ten years at this apartment.  He 
               was going up the stairs, carrying a heavy tool, 
               an old-looking bowl and a bag that was dripping 
               blood.  I never saw him again after that.  But a 
               few days later, the neighbors complained that 
               they heard strange noises coming from the 
               supposedly empty Room 302.  So I took a look 
               around Room 302 and found signs that someone had 
               been in there, but nothing odd other than that.  
               But that's when it all started.  I still hear 
               strange noises coming from the window of Room 302.

               Sunderland"

Henry enters into Room 302.  The Room 302 from the past.

Two things sit on the coffee table and they read as follows:

               "There was once a baby and a mother who were 
               connected by a magical cord.  But one day the 
               cord was cut, and the mother went to sleep.  The 
               baby was left all alone.  But the baby made lots 
               of friends at Wish House, and everyone was very 
               nice to him.  The baby was happy.  His friends 
               told him how to wake up his mother.  So the baby 
               went right away to go and wake her up.  But the 
               mother wouldn't wake up.  No matter how hard he 
               tried, she wouldn't wake up.  Because the one 
               that he was trying to wake up was actualy the 
               Devil.  The baby had been deceived.  Poor baby.  
               The baby cried and cried and cried.  When he 
               thought of the mother, he remembered the feeling 
               of being connected to her through the magical 
               cord.  Just then a ray of light came down from 
               the sky.  The light was very warm and made the 
               baby feel good.  When the baby looked into his 
               hand, he saw that the magical cord was lying 
               there.  With the cord clutched in his hand, the 
               baby went happily to sleep."

               "Crimson Tome

               She who is called the "Holy Mother" be not holy 
               one whit.  The "Descent of the Holy Mother" is 
               naught but the Descent of the Devil.  Those that 
               be called the "21 Sacraments" be not sacramental 
               one whit.  The "21 Sacraments" be not bu the 21 
               Heresies.  To give birth to a realm of kickedness 
               within the blessed realm of our Lord be blasphemy 
               and the work of the Devil.  If thou would stop 
               the Descent of the Devil, you must bury part of 
               the Conjurer's mother's flesh within the 
               Conjurer's true body.  Thou must also pierce the 
               Conjurer's flesh with the 8 spears of "Void," 
               "Darkness," "Gloom," "Despair," "Temptation," 
               "Source," Watchfulness," and "Chaos."  Do so and 
               the Conjurer's unholy flesh will become that 
               which once it was, by the grace of our Lord."

In Henry's room there are a total of four red pieces of paper:

               "What's wrong with this room?  It's covered in 
               blood and rust... This is my room... But what the 
               hell has happened to it...?  This room... Is it 
               really my room...?  It's in terrible shape... The 
               air is so heavy... My head hurts... Creepy... it 
               looks like a face.  What the hell am I 
               writing...?

               August 2 - Joseph"

               "I can't break down the wall.  

               August 3 - Joseph"

               "When the bell rings, Eileen = mother's body, 
               blood.  

               August 4 - Joseph"

               "The Crimson Tome
               "Bury part of the Conjurer's mother's flesh 
               within the true body of the Conjurer."
               Part of the flesh = super's room?

               August 5 - Joseph"

Back in the living room, Henry finds the ghost of Joseph Schreiber.  Joseph 
explains how Walter considered this room to be his mother, and performed the 
ritual of the Holy Mother.  Even now in dead he is trying to complete the 
task.  Number 20, "The Mother Reborn" is Eileen Galvin, and number 21, is 
Henry Townshend.  No matter where they run Walter will find them.  It may not 
be too late, follow the Crimson Tome he says, kill Walter is the only 
solution.  Using the hole in the bathroom, Henry returns to his apartment.

Also in the lauundry room there was a loud crash, and a memo on the ground:

               "He used this place as the locus for the creation 
               of his world.  I'm certain he must have performed 
               the "Ritual of the Holy Assumption" near here.  
               But I'm not strong enough to stop him anymore... 
               He locked me up in this room and played with me 
               just like a toy... My eyes started to go blind... 
               The Pain... I can feel my body starting to die... 
               But... things are taken care of... Whoever lives 
               here after me... You'll be the 21st, the last of 
               the sacrifices... I leave it up to you...
               When the bell tolls, the ritual begins.  Eileen = 
               mother's body, blood.  Part of the mother's flesh 
               = the super's room.  This is all that I've been 
               able to figure out.  I hope this letter gets to 
               you in time...

               Joseph Schreiber"

After using his pickaxe on the wall at the end of the hall, Henry manages to 
break open a hole.  Inside he finds all sorts of ritual items, and the real 
body of Walter Sullivan, crucified on a cross with some kind of pipes running 
through his body, and 11/21 carved into his feet.  On his body are the Keys of 
Liberation which finally unlock the door to Henry's apartment to let him out.

The halls and walls have been covered in a disgusting red substance, the whole 
apartment it seems has gone evil.  They make their way through it down to the 
first floor where Eileen sees a sketchbook on the ground, inside it is some 
kind of stick figure drawing of "Walter's father"?  She stops following Henry 
at this point and remains only to stand by the sketchbook.  In the next area 
Henry finds corpses hanging from ropes, when he looks at them he hears the 
following words. "I told you we shouldn't have a baby," "Anyway, let's get out 
of here, I can't stand it anymore...", "You little crybaby," "If that super 
hears him we're in trouble.  There's something about that guy... I just don't 
like the look of him...," "Oh shut the hell up, you can't blame it all on 
me," "Hurry up -- get packed!"  Back in the hall where Eileen stayed, she 
meets Henry again saying she feels sorry for the little boy who was abandoned 
by his parents and wants to help him.  In the superintendent's room Henry 
opens the case containing the umbilical cord.  Henry falls to the ground in 
pain.  Eileen says that even finishing the 21 Sacraments will not help that 
boy, and she's going back to help him.  Eileen then leaves.  Outside the room 
there is a sketch on the ground of a woman, possibly Eileen, with some kind of 
round spiky contraption surrounding her.  Back in Henry's room, Walter's 
corpse has disappeared from the secret room leaving only some kind of 
blackened hole at the base of the cross, leading to some other dimension.

__||______||______________________________________________________||______||__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a total of four endings in Silent Hill 4, and the requirements to 
get each one are not very complicated at all.  They are as follows:

Escape --------- All or most of the hauntings in your apartment are eliminated
               - Eileen Galvin survives the final battle

Mother --------- Very few of the hauntings in your apartment are eliminated
               - Eileen Galvin survives the final battle

Eileen's Death - All or most of the hauntings in your apartment are eliminated
               - Eileen Galvin does not survive the final battle

21 Sacraments -- Very few of the hauntings in your apartment are eliminated
               - Eileen Galvin does not survive the final battle
______________________________________________________________________________

When the game has been completed there is a ratings screen, the best possible 
rating you can get like the other games is of course a ten large star rating.  
In order to do this the following conditions must be satisfied:

- The game must be completed on hard mode
- The game must be completed in less than 2:00:00 (Two hours)
- The game is not saved once
- The player does not use the "continue" option once
- A minimum of 120 enemies are defeated
- A minimum of 50 memos (out of 52) are found
- The ending you get is irrelevant

As a bonus, finding all 52 memos will allow you to save once, and complete the 
game in under 2:30:00 and still obtain the ten star ranking.

A ranking of ten starts unlocks some bonus options and features which are 
separate from the normal items unlocked just by beating the game (the Chainsaw 
and Submachine Gun for example).  To play a new game with these special 
bonuses, you must load the "New Fear" save game you made afer the credits 
rolled and you will be able to begin anew with any bonuses you acquired.
