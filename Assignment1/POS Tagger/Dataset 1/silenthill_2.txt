Version 1.5
***************
Well, it has been 3 whole years since this guide was last updated.
It has been gahering a lot of dust in that time and I'm sure interest in 
this game has waned since then. Having said that, I know that this was my
first walkthrough and is one which I look back at fondly. It certainly was a
lot of fun to write, and Silent Hill is one of the finest games available 
for the PSX. I apologize for the lack of updates and hope that you will
have found this guide useful for this is the final update. It is better to
draw a line under this rather than leaving it undone any longer, so lots of
luck playing Silent Hill.

FEB 21ST 2002.
Version 1.0
***************
This is the first installment of my Silent Hill walkthrough. It was a 
tough few weeks getting it done but I can finally put my feet up and 
retire for a while. I will update this game for quite a while and will 
spruce it up in the future.

Version 1.1
APR 17TH 2002.

Not much new here really, just a spot check, maybe the problems have 
been ironed out finally.

===---===---===---===
I: INTRODUCTION
===---===---===---===
Silent Hill. From the outside, Silent Hill would appear to be an ideal 
haven. Remote, tranquil, beautiful and yet this leads you into a false 
sense of security. Silent Hill is not the serene picturesque lakeside 
resort it appears to be. Silent Hill has age-old secrets, a legacy that 
the locals are not aware of. Silent Hill is covered in a thick fog that 
has appeared as if from nowhere. Roads out of town are obliterated. 
Vehicles have stopped functioning. Where is everybody? What on earth 
happened here?
This is all revealed to young writer Harry Mason. An average guy, Harry 
is thrust into a strange situation where his daughter is missing. Harry 
must save his daughter from this strange town, whilst dodging creatures 
of the night, traipsing around this huge district and meeting up with 
the not so trustworthy locals in order to find the source of this 
nightmare. What Konami did with Silent Hill was to initially create a 
rival for the popular Resident Evil series. Konami went better than 
that. The truth is, Konami created a completely original title that 
surpassed the Resident evil series in some areas. It is a truly 
terrifying yet compelling experience and a joy to play what stands out 
the most is the differences between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.
Harry is a writer, an average Joe who wants to recover his daughter 
from a strange town; he is not a Hero in the Solid Snake sense of the 
word. He's in proficient with firearms. He is merely acting out his 
paternal instincts. I have created this guide partly because I have 
noticed that there are only a few FAQ/Walkthroughs for this game 
currently on GameFAQs, and because I wanted to help other people's out 
there who are stuck in the confines of this cursed town and need help. 
I hope this guide will serve you well, fellow Survivalists. Good Luck.

===---===---===---===
II: Basic Tips
===---===---===---===
Harry is not an expert in his situation and needs all the help he can 
get. I hope that these Basic Tips will help you succeed in the 
dangerous world of Silent Hill.

******
Torch
******
Harry is not a cat, e cannot see in the dark. The flashlight is 
obtained near the beginning of the game and will prove to be a 
lifesaver throughout. This lights up the predominantly dark areas of 
Silent Hill and fits neatly in Harry's breast pocket. Learn to use it 
efficiently. When the torch isn't equipped you cannot see the map, aim 
well or pick up items.

***
Map
***
Maps to all locations are available in the game, usually when you enter 
a new area. In order to get around in Silent Hill properly, you will 
need to learn to consult the map often to find out where you are going 
and what doors open or not. Often I will tell you to refer to your map 
in order to proceed. Really, learning to map read is a good way of 
succeeding in Silent Hill.

*******
Weapons
*******
Ammo is scarce; so don't rush in all guns blazing. Running away can 
circumvent many battles with the enemy. Don't be worried about being 
branded a coward, as the monsters can't talk. Also, try and use the 
melee weapons as often as possible. It saves ammo and sometimes is more 
efficient.

******
Health
******
The bad thing for the color blind is Silent Hill uses a color-coded 
system of health. Red means danger, obviously, while green refers to 
Perfect health. After fights, check your health often.

There are 3 ways of replenishing Harry's life bar.

-----------------
1: Health Drinks
-----------------
They are extremely common; you'll be finding them everywhere. They only 
restore a moderate amount of life however, but they are certainly worth 
picking up.

------------------
2: First Aid Kits
------------------
Common, but much rarer than health drinks. They restore most of you're 
life in a snap, so don't go wasting them when a health drink would be 
sufficient.

-----------
3: Ampoule
-----------
You will only find about 3-4 in the game, but they are worth it. Not 
only do they restore full health, but also they give off a short period 
of immunity to attacks. Save these for the boss battles later on in the 
game.

---------
The Radio
---------
This small Pocket radio is found early on in the game, and for some 
reason emits static when an enemy is close by. If you hear a crackling, 
then it's time to lock and load. Very handy throughout the course of 
the game.


===---===---===---===
III: Monsters
===---===---===---===

Please note that the following monster list is actually not the 
official names for them, I just named them what I thought best suited 
them. Okay?

----------
Teddy bear
----------
The Teddy Bear is the standard monster in Silent Hill. He first makes 
an appearance in the opening scenes and then appears throughout the 
School. Then he returns in the final section of the game at the 
Lakeside Resort. They roam the corridors in an attempt to claw you to 
death or stab you with kitchen knives. A couple of well-placed Handgun 
Bullets should do the trick. The Steel Pipe is useful also.

---------
Clickers
---------
The Clickers are insect like monsters that roam the dank smelly 
corridors of the Silent Hill Sewage System. To kill Harry, they use 
their strength to crush his legs and claws to slash his ankles. The 
problem with these is you can never be sure when they are dead. They 
simply stand there dead. Be careful when running past fallen Clickers!
Shotgun works best, By the way.

------------
Flying Demon
------------
Bloody Annoying! They sweep down from the foggy skies whilst attempting 
to sink their talons into Harry's scalp!
You will encounter these from the opening few minutes right through to 
the end (Nearly). As they sweep at you, try and take them down with the 
Handgun. Once on the floor they are disabled.

------
Apeman
------
The Apeman makes his first appearance in Central Silent Hill and 
refuses to give up the ghost even when you run away from them! Run away 
and the camera wills witch to a chase perspective, and they will then 
jump on you in an attempt to crush you. Intimidated? You shouldn't be! 
A few Shotgun blasts should send them home packing.

-------------
Skinless Dog
-------------
What was once probably an adorable family pet has been transformed into 
an evil skinless dog, bent on causing misery for Harry. They are not 
really worth fighting since the decomposition on their bodies has made 
them slower than Marlon Brando, but if you feel the need, The Handgun 
works wonders.

-------------------
Zombie Nurse/Doctor
-------------------
Zombified Nurses and Doctors roam the decrepit corridors of the 
Alchemilla hospital and nowhere. Coming complete with a Maggot hump on 
their back and armed with a crafty knife, the Zombified Medical Staff 
of Silent Hill could prove to be formidable opponents for the unwary. 
If I were you, I'd stick with the shotgun to cut them down quick, and 
then resort to the hammer. Difficult in large numbers, as well.

------
Ghosts
------
These Ghosts are actually Ghost babies that appear in nowhere. These 
transparent buggers will bite at your legs while you swear at the 
screen saying 'I couldn't see the bugger!' Let the radio do the looking 
while you frantically blast them with your Handgun!

===---===---===---===
IV: WEAPONS
===---===---===---===

----------------
FIREARMS
----------------

--------------
HANDGUN
--------------
The Handgun will be the first weapon that Harry will obtain, from Cybil 
in the Cafe, and will serve as your most loyal ally throughout the 
first section of the game. Actually, you will be using it right towards 
the end. The Handgun has small stopping power and an average range 
however, but Ammo is plentiful, so you can use it as often as you like.
Remember to keep picking up handgun ammo even when you are nearing the 
end of the game, just so you have backup in case things turn nasty.

---------------
SHOTGUN
---------------
The Shotgun can be found at the start of the Alternate School section 
in the boy's toilet. If you miss it here you can pick it up again at 
the police station. Either way, you should come across it at least 
once. The Shotgun is a poor gun in comparison to the rifle; it feels 
more like an upgraded Handgun. But get used to it, for it is required 
for the first boss of the game, and comes with Average Range and above 
average damage. When you come across it in the school, be sure to save 
any and all ammunition you can find.


---------------
HUNTING RIFLE
---------------
This is by far the best firearm in the game. It uses high-powered Rifle 
shells that can take down generic enemies with only a few shots. Do not 
get trigger happy, though, for ammo is quite scarce and you'll want to 
save it for use on the bosses of the game. A long range and the 
powerful blast compensate the fact that you can't move while aiming.

------------
HYPERBLASTER
------------
The Hyperblaster is a version of Konami's old lightgun, which can only 
be obtained by getting the UFO ending, that is only possible in next 
fear mode. So the earliest possible time of getting this item is in 
your third play through. Although it comes with a Laser sight, the red 
version is about as powerful as the shotgun. Getting higher stars on 
the end game ranking will give you more powerful variants of this gun. 
It comes equipped with infinite ammo.

-------------
MELEE WEAPONS
-------------

---------------
KITCHEN KNIFE 
---------------
The Kitchen Knife is the first Melee weapon Harry will obtain and is 
also the most useless. It can only be used at extremely close range and 
is so weak; it will barely scratch the teddy bears that you encounter 
in the school, and don't even think about using it on the ape-men. I'd 
only trust it on the giant cockroaches. Still, It's better than your 
bear hands. A Tap will mean a slash while a press of X will stab your 
enemy.

--------------
STEEL PIPE 
--------------
The steel pipe is a useful addition to Harry's Arsenal. It can be swung 
down to crush the skulls of enemies and also has the long range with 
which to do this. It can also be used to smash a lock late in the game 
in case you missed certain other tools. Can be found in the alleyway 
where you discover Cheryl's notes.

--------------
HAMMER
--------------
Don't be put off by the name for this is no DIY tool. Actually it's 
more of a pickaxe, like the ones Construction workers use. It can be 
found in the generator room of the alternate hospital and can deal out 
extreme damage to the demon nurses. It takes about 2-3 smacks to take 
them down and when they do, they hold their heads writhing in agony. 
One of the most useful Melee weapons in the game.

-------------
AXE
-------------
The Axe is the second poorest weapon in the game. It can be described 
as an upgraded Knife. It has longer range than the Knife but a weak 
damage rate. One good point Is that you can run whilst using it and is 
also required to smash a lock later on, although different tools can 
make this tool obsolete. Still, it's a lot more reliable than the 
Knife, so it can be used as an alternative.

-----------
CHAINSAW 
-----------
This Gas powered machine is a favorite of Leatherface, and can make 
chop suey of most enemies. It can be found in the broken shop window of 
Cut Write Chainsaws in Bloch Street, but can only be obtained in Next 
fear mode once you have the Gas canister. Once obtained, this weapon 
can be swung about everywhere making mincemeat of most living things 
including the Apemen who can only take a few swipes before kicking the 
bucket.

-----------
ROCK DRILL
-----------
The Rock Drill can also only be obtained in Next Fear Mode provided you 
have the gas canister. This means you must choose between the two, and 
sadly, the Chainsaw is a lot more deadly than the rock drill. You must 
stand still when using it and have to wait for enemies to walk into it. 
You can jab with it which also results in extreme damage, but sadly 
doesn't match up to the saw in terms of overall performance. Still it's 
quite good! Can be found in the lower drawbridge control room.

-----------
KATANA 
-----------
The appearance of the Katana is a source of debate amongst forums 
throughout the web. Some say it is obtained after getting the Bad+ 
ending whilst others claim it appears randomly throughout the game. 
However it is obtained, it's there for use and this Gray Fox favourite 
proves to be a very deadly weapon as Harry uses it with frightening 
proficiency. 


===---===---===---===
V: FILES
===---===---===---===
Unlike the resident evil games, Silent Hill doesn't archive the files 
that you read in the game. So now, I have put every file encountered in 
the game up in my FAQ, each with a specific location, so you now have 
an instant reference resource at your disposal. The Files are listed in 
the order they are found.

---------------------------
FILE 1: ALCHEMY LABORATORY

FILE 6: THE MONSTER LURKS
-------------------------------------
Location: Library, Alternate School.

Hearing this, the hunter armed with bow and arrow said, "I will kill 
the Lizard." But upon meeting his opponent, he held back, taunting, " 
Who's afraid of a Reptile". At this the furious Lizard hissed, "I'll 
swallow you in a single bite!" then, the huge creature attacked, jaws 
open wide. This was what the man wanted. Calmly drawing his bow, he 
shot into the Lizards gaping mouth. Effortlessly the arrow flew, 
piercing the defenseless maw. And the Lizard fell down dead.

-------------------------------------

VI: CHOOSING MODES
===---===---===---===
Before you start Silent Hill, you will be given the option of choosing 
a difficulty level.

Please note that the walkthrough was written whilst playing through the 
'Normal' difficulty level.

===---===---===---===--
VII: NOTEPAD LOCATIONS
===---===---===---===--
Obviously due to copyrights, Silent Hill couldn't use typewriters and 
ink ribbons. So instead they have opted for the more practical notepad 
as a means of saving your progress. Take note that there will, be 
several Notepads in each area of the game. I will now write down the 
know locations of Notepads throughout the game indexed in the district 
they are in, so the gamer can have an easy reference for save points.

IX: Characters
===---===---===---===

-----------
Harry Mason
-----------
Harry Mason is the reluctant hero of Silent Hill. Harry arrived in the 
suburb on vacation at the request of his seven year old daughter, 
Cheryl. Following the death of his wife from illness, Harry raised her 
on his own and she had become the whole world to him. Of course his 
main priority is to find Cheryl any way he can. But Harry is 
disorientated and lost in the foggy depths of Silent Hill and must 
pluck up all the courage inside his body to help a loved one and get 
out of this place alive. Although Harry is one of the 'Straightest' 
Characters in the game, he too has his own 'Skeletons in the closet' 
that will all be revealed in time.

-------------
Cybil Bennett
-------------
Cybil is the first human that Harry encounters in Silent Hill. Cybil is 
a beautiful young Police Officer from Brahms, the next town over. What 
she is doing alone in Silent Hill is still a mystery possibly she is 
here to investigate links between murders and a rumored local narcotics 
ring. Cybil gives Harry her backup Pistol, and then leaves to round up 
some reinforcements. Cybil is the secondary character that Harry 
obviously looks to as his closest ally. As the game advances, Romance 
blossoms between the two. Well, maybe.

----------------
Dahlia Gillespie
----------------
Based on appearance, Dahlia looks like an old woman, and is yet in her 
forties apparently. Harry first meets up with this crackpot in the 
Balkan Church where she summons him. Her talk is mainly gibberish that 
Harry finds hard to understand. Although these ramblings seem insane at 
first, towards the end, what she says begins to make sense. Although 
she seems to be a loony, Dahlia often points Harry in the right 
direction giving him hints on how to defeat the 'Darkness'. Her past is 
disturbing and will be revealed before the end of the game.

--------------------
Dr. Michael Kaufmann
--------------------
Kaufmann is the head physician at the Alchemilla Hospital in Central 
Silent Hill. Upon encountering Harry for the first time, he mistakes 
Harry for a demon and takes a potshot at him. The Doctor acts in a very 
suspicious manner-he claims he just woke up and found it like this, yet 
has bloodshot eyes suggesting he has been awake for days. He is very 
Shifty around Harry and often abruptly (And Rudely) leaves when being 
questioned. All he wants to do is escape, but may know more than he's 
letting on.

------------
Lisa Garland
------------
Lisa is a nurse at the hospital and is the second person Harry meets 
there, albeit only in the nightmare version. She has not seen to many 
little girls running around and is as clueless as everybody about the 
situation in the town. She is overjoyed when she sees Harry and a trust 
develops between the two, yet refuses to leave with him when he offers. 
She appears quite often in the latter stages of the game.

------------
Cheryl Mason
------------
Cheryl is Harry's good-natured seven-year-old daughter, whose 
disappearance has sparked Harry's desperate search throughout the town. 
Cheryl will appear rarely throughout the game often posing subtle hints 
to her Father about her location. She is integral to the plot and to 
the whole madness that is occurring in Silent Hill.

--------
Alessa
--------
Alessa is a mysterious girl who Harry sees, usually I the form of a 
ghostly young girl. She never speaks and often seems to be trying to 
tell Harry something. Very little is known about her, but as the game 
moves along, more will be gathered about her past.

----------------
OTHER CHARACTERS
----------------
I know that there are only the seven principal characters, but there 
are some small yet significant players in the plot.

----------------
NORMAN YOUNG
----------------
Young is the owner of the Motel In the Lakeside resort. From what we 
know he's a middleman in the whole affair, probably involved in the 
peddling of Kaufmann's drugs and whatnot. I don't think he was high up 
on the food chain of this incident.

--------------
OFFICER GUCCI
--------------
Gucci was one of the Narcotics officers who was investigating the White 
Claudia epidemic in Silent Hill. He was killed most likely by the cult 
when he got too close to the truth. We learn of him by Files and Memos 
scattered in the town. His purpose is to show to the player how the 
Cult deals with outsiders. Not very nice then.

I have ordered it into chapters so you will find it easy to negotiate, 
and these chapters will be split into mini quests to make it a lot 
easier. Good luck once again.

===---===---===---===
Prologue
===---===---===---===
[Harry Mason awakes in his Jeep Wrangler by the road. He takes a few 
seconds to gain his senses, and then peers into the back seat to check 
on his daughter, Cheryl. Cheryl is not there. Dazed, Harry opens the 
door of his Jeep and surfaces at the grey murky town of Silent Hill. 
Where on earth could Cheryl be? Harry asks himself. Strange thing is, 
Harry muses, there are no people around and it's snowing in 
August/September! Something is definitely wrong in this town...
Harry then resumes his search for Cheryl.]

When you finally gain control of Harry, head in the immediate direction 
for a while until you get a cutscene where the computer takes over.

[Harry sees a figure off in the distance. Is it Cheryl? Harry walks 
forwards and sees a little girl. Cheryl. Cheryl ignores Harry's cries 
and runs off, leaving Harry trailing behind. 'Hey wait, Stop! He says.]

For a few seconds you will see Cheryl through the fog. Follow her 
footsteps precisely. If you go off the map, the computer will take over 
for you and put you back on the right track. After a few seconds of 
jogging, Cheryl will turn off into an alley. You should follow this 
alley until it ends. Turn left and enter the gate with 'BEWARE OF DOG' 
scrawled on the front. When you enter this gate, notice the remains on 
the floor. What was this, I wonder.
Follow the path round until you come to another gate round the corner. 
Notice how it gets progressively darker in that area.
When you enter the next alley it will be completely pitch black. Walk 
forwards a few paces and Harry will make a makeshift torch from a 
match. Better than nothing, I guess. As you follow the corridor round, 
notice the weird out of places items. A Hospital Gurney, a wheelchair. 
What on earth are they doing here? When you come to the gurney, make a 
right turn and follow this alley till you come to a clearing.

[In the middle of the clearing, Harry will see a decomposing corpse 
pinned to a fence. As Harry recoils in Horror, 3 demonic creatures in 
the form of teddy bears enter the room armed with knifes]

Don't bother running from the demonic Teddies. All the doors are 
barricaded. It's no use. Allow the teddies to kill Harry if you want to 
continue with the game.

[As the Teddy strikes the final blow on Harry Mason, he slumps to the 
floor, dead.]

===============
NOTICE
===============
After completing the game, the above scenario will not be played any 
more. The game will start at the Cafe.

===---===---===---===---===
CHAPTER I: OLD SILENT HILL
===---===---===---===---===

[Harry Mason awakes suddenly. He's not in his Jeep. After a moment of 
searching the room, he notices that he is in a diner. As he does so, a 
female police officer walks towards him. The officer introduces herself 
as Cybil Bennett, a Cop from Brahms the next town over. After a series 
of introductorily exchanges, Harry says he is looking for his daughter 
and asks Cybil if she has seen her. She hasn't. In fact, Harry is the 
only person she has seen in town. She mentions that the radio and the 
phones are out. Then, Harry motions for the door in an effort to find 
Cheryl. 'Hold It!' Cybil exclaims and then tells Harry that 'This town 
is dangerous'. She then gives him a Handgun for protection. She leaves, 
supposedly to round up some reinforcements.]

---------
The Cafe
---------
Now that Cybil has left you alone here, you can raid the Cafe.
Now that you have the HANDGUN, equip it immediately.
First, pick up the KITCHEN KNIFE that's lying next to the TV and the 
HEALTH DRINK that's next to it. Now pick up another HEALTH DRINK, The 
MAP OF SILENT HILL and the FLASHLIGHT. Before you leave, notice the 
notepad that's lying on the counter. The Notepad acts as a save beacon, 
and you will be able to find them throughout the game. Accessing them 
requires a tap of 'x'. Now, make your leave of the cafe.

[But wait. The radio that's on one of the tables begins emitting 
static. Harry is bemused and investigates. Then, there is a crash at 
the window. It breaks open in a shower of glass. In its place is a 
winged demon.]

You should have the handgun equipped, so simply fire away at it a few 
times until it is dead. With the beast dead, pick up the radio from the 
table and you can now take your leave from the Cafe.

===============
TRIVIA 
===============
The name of this Cafe is 5.2, the same name as the one featured in the 
opening sequence of Oliver Stone's Controversial Natural Born Killers.

-----------------------------------
ALLEYWAYS AND THE CONVENIENCE STORE
-----------------------------------
When you exit the cafe, Harry will note down the location of the alley 
he chased Cheryl in. Surely something will be there.
Of course you will want to go to the alley first, but I have a better 
idea. First turn right from the Cafe, taking the sidewalk down. Soon 
you will come to a building called 'QUEEN BURGER' (Subtle, eh?), where 
you will find a health drink on the windowsill. Continue on the 
sidewalk you are on, round the corner from Queen Burger. On your left 
you should see and alleyway which you should take. Follow this alley 
whilst hugging the left hand sidewall, and about 3/4 of the way up you 
will see a gate. Take the gate.

You will now be in a basketball court, where someone has slam-dunked a 
dog's head. Yuck. Pick up the KEY OF WOODMAN from underneath the net 
and the HEALTH DRINK from the dumpster. Exit the court and go up they 
alley again and head into FINNEY STREET. Use your map for directions 
and find the Bachman Road/Finney Street intersection. Go up Bachman 
Road towards the underpass. Keeping to the left hand side of Bachman 
Road you will come across your Jeep. Cheryl is not here, but a Health 
drink will be. Pick it up, cross over to the right side of the road and 
follow that down until you get to the CONVENIENCE STORE car park. Enter 
through the slightly ajar door, being very careful not to disturb the 
flying demon that resides on the Wheelie Bin.
Once inside, Pick up the three health drinks from the shelves and the 
First Aid Kit. Then leave. 

Now, consult your map again and get back to the FINNEY/BACHMAN 
intersection. This time we are turning right (From the Bachman road's 
point of view.). Keep to the left hand side and you should find the 
alley you came to earlier. It's marked on your map; so if you are 
confused, use that to help. Continue down the back alley until your 
radio starts going Haywire. Up to 3 ZOMBIE DOGS will be here guarding 
their territory. These aren't the kind you can tell to sit. At this 
time you probably will have negligible ammo, so outrun them and enter 
the gate. There will be another dog here, but maybe only on hard mode. 
Collect the ammo at the end of the alley and the STEEL PIPE. Also, you 
will observe that a cave in has meant that access to the side where 
Cheryl ran. You will find some clues to her whereabouts though, by 
reading the pieces of coloring book littering the floor. It says 'TO 
THE SCHOOL'. Harry theorizes that Cheryl may well be at the school on 
Midwich Street, but since the roads are blocked we must find an 
alternate route there. That is our next goal.

-------------------
THE ALTERNATE ROUTE
-------------------
You may remember that you have the KEY OF WOODMAN in your possession. 
But you need two more keys to be able to proceed. Now, backtrack the 
way you came and exit the alley. You will now have some ammo, so Kill 
the dogs and run back out onto Finney Street. Now, turn RIGHT all the 
way to the end. Try and Outrun the Flying Demons that you encounter.
Towards the end of Finney Street, you will be on the bridge. But the 
Bridge has broken. Notice the Abandoned Police Car on the bridge. 
Eliminate the two Flying demons that guard it and pick up the BULLETS 
on the gravel and the KEY OF LION from the Trunk.

==================
DISTURBING STUFF 
==================
Take a look at the Police Car at the end of Finney Street in self-view 
mode (I Apologize if I tend to use this mode a lot. It's just that 
there's so much cool stuff to be find using this.). Look at the bonnet. 
It's like someone flew out the window and into the abyss. (Who found 
this first?)

Now we need to backtrack a small way back Finney street until we come 
to ELLROY STREET, the location for the third and final key. Head down 
ELLROY until you come to yet another destroyed road. There is a wooden 
plank on the right hand side that you will want to cross to the other 
side. A Flying Demon is here usually so watch out. Pick up the HEALTH 
DRINK from the Porch and the KEY OF SCAREWCROW from the Mailbox.

----------------------
LEVIN STREET
----------------------
Now we have three keys, where are they to be used?
Now find Matheson Street on your Map. Run down Matheson Street on the 
LEFT HAND SIDE. After a short while of running you will come across a 
short alley that has two cases of BULLETS. Further on on the left hand 
side will be a FIRST AID KIT. Still on Matheson, head right to the end 
where the road will be obliterated once more. Search around for a while 
and the camera will focus on some pieces of paper lying on the floor. 
You should examine these. It's from Cheryl again.
'DOG HOUSE LEVIN STREET' reads the piece of paper. Next stop, Levin 
Street. Head up Levin Street on the left hand side and eventually your 
radio will begin crackling _Again_. This means that the former 
residents of the doghouse are guarding their property and they do NOT 
like Intruders. Waste 'Em all and examine the dog's house to find the 
HOUSE KEY. Use it on the House. 

There is nobody in the house of course, but they have left some goodies 
for you. The first aid kit and The TWO HANDGUN BULLETS should be 
collected, as well as the HEALTH DRINK from the kitchen. You should now 
go to the back door and use the keys you found on it.

---------------
SCHOOL RUN
---------------

[The turning of the three keys has resulted in a total eclipse of the 
sun over Silent Hill. It's obviously dark now. Unnerved, Harry makes 
his way to the school.]

Turn on the Flashlight with the Circle button. Now, Obtain the HEALTH 
DRINKS from the Plastic Table and leave through the wooden door to 
enter into _Another_ alleyway.
This time you will want to turn left. Follow this alleyway and when it 
turns into MATHESON STREET, look at the map. There is another Alley 
that you can follow. Do so, picking up the AMMO and the HEALTH DRINK 
along the way. Finally when the alley ends you will be on BLOCH STREET. 
Turn Right past the light bulb place and cross into Midwich Street. 
Cross onto the far side of the road and Run, Forrest, Run! Run right 
down past the waterworks and enter the school consulting the map if you 
become disorientated. You will meet many enemies on the way, so beware. 
You will also see tones of Dogs near the school entrance, so try and 
outrun them. Now, enter the school through the front door.

============
WEIRD STUFF
============
On Midwich Street, on the left hand side about half way down is a 
street that starts and ends at an obliterated road section. This road 
obviously doesn't lead anywhere and seems to be there just for show.

===---===---===---======---===--
CHAPTER II: MIDWICH ELEMENTARY 
===---===---===---======---===--
[After a mad dash through the pitch-black streets of Silent Hill, Harry 
Mason has finally made it to the school, where he hopes to finally find 
his daughter.]

-----------
LOBBY AREA
-----------
Regain your breath as soon as you enter the lobby. That run really took 
out Harry's stamina! Now, take the MAP OF SCHOOL from the notice board 
directly to your left. There's nothing else to do in here for the 
moment so enter the door directly ahead of you to the hallway.
There will be another set of double doors staring at you when you enter 
the hallway, but you can ignore these for the time being and instead 
enter the door to the right of where you entered. This is the 
Infirmary. Take the First aid kit from the cabinet behind the bed and 
use the NOTEPAD if necessary. Now reenter the hallway from the way you 
entered and run down the end of the hall again ignoring the double 
doors. You'll now be in the reception area. You will find a list of 
teachers and a poem that will make no sense to you, but rest assured 
I'll try and make the puzzles easy for you. 
Here are the three poems:

      10:00
  'Alchemy laboratory.'
'Gold in old man's palm.
The future hidden in his fist.
Exchange for Sage's Salt water.

    12:00
'A place with songs and sounds. 
A silver guidepost is 
Untapped in lost tongues.
Awakening at the ordained order.'

    5:00
'Darkness that brings the choking heat.
Flames render the silence awakening the hungry
Beast. Open time's door to beckon prey.

Now Find the single door in the back of the reception area and pick up 
the BULLETS from the couch. On the wall notice the bizarre picture. It 
will come up again soon.
Reenter the hallway again, but this time equip your Handgun and enter 
the previously ignored double doors to enter the courtyard.

----------------
CLOCK TOWER
----------------
For the next 15-20 minutes of gameplay you will find yourself trudging 
back and forth from different sections of the school back here.
For now, those Demon Teddies that viciously attacked Harry in his dream 
are back with a vengeance. Cut down the first one with a few Handgun 
Bullets and the kick it to make sure it's dead. His buddy will be 
lurking around as well so deal him the same justice. Once they're dead, 
examine the Clock Tower. You'll find two hollows. You will now go on a 
quest to find these components. Now, enter the double doors opposite 
the ones you entered.

--------------------
A GOLDEN SUN
--------------------
The poem that was found in the reception area mentioned an 'Alchemy 
Lab'. I don't think we'll find one of those in a simple elementary 
school, do you? I think the most likely destination would be the second 
floor Chemistry Laboratory. And that is our next destination.
When you enter this door, your radio will begin cackling again. Ignore 
the 2 Teddies for the time being and enter the door directly ahead of 
you. Inside the storeroom your radio will again be in full swing but 
you can't see anything. These are the much despised ghost babies that I 
mentioned in the monster guide. Don't worry about them for now, they 
can't hurt you. Not yet, anyway. Oh and don't get startled by the 
distinct yelps they make. As compensation, collect the BULLETS from the 
bench and make good your escape. Now cut down the 2 Teddies and enter 
the double doors to the far right of the storeroom. You will now be in 
the South Hallway. Go up the staircase directly ahead of you. You will 
funnily enough arrive at the second floor of Midwich elementary school. 
In front of you, slightly to the right, you will find another hallway 
which you should enter using the double doors. There will be another 
Teddy waiting for you here so make sure you kill him before he gets too 
close. Then enter the first door on the left. 

==================
INTERESTING STUFF
==================
The teachers on the register in the reception area are named after the 
members of band Sonic Youth:
Kim Gordon, Leonard Renaldo and Thurston Moore.

---------------
LABORATORY
---------------
Search the LAB EQUIPMENT ROOMS shelves until you obtain the 
HYDROCHLORIC ACID. Now look at your map and find the CHEMISTRY LAB. See 
it? Next-door down. Enter it and look at the worktable in the center of 
the room. Upon examining the STATUE OF HAND, you'll find that it is 
holding a gold medallion. Use the ACID you found in the previous room 
to corrode the Hand and obtain the MEDALLION. You must now return to 
the Courtyard and use the medallion on the hollow that says 'A Golden 
Sun'. The time on the clock will now change to 12:00. But now you must 
find a Silver moon. The Poem back in the reception area mentioned a 
place with songs and sounds. The Music room perhaps? That's our next 

port of entry.

-------------
A SILVER MOON
-------------
Make your way back to the second floor, and enter the Eastern hallway. 
Enter the piano room and you will find that the Piano is now unlocked.

The Poem on the blackboard will give you some clues:

'A tale of birds without a voice'
First flew the greedy Pelican
White wings flailing eager for the reward.
Then came a silent Dove, flying beyond the pelican, 
As far as he could. A Raven flies in, flying higher from
The Dove, just to show he can.
A Swan glides in to find a peaceful spot,
Next to another bird. Finally, out comes a Crow, 
Coming quickly to a stop yawning and the napping.
Who will show the way?
Who will be the key?
Who will tend to the silver reward?
 
Examine the keys of the piano and you will find that there is blood on 
them. This is the first INTERACTIVE PUZZLE you will find. You will now 
have a Cursor, which will play the piano. If you press certain keys you 
will find that they are not functioning properly and make a blunt 
sound. These are the ones that you need to press in order to obtain the 
Silver Medallion. 

From Left to right the Keys should be marked 1-5.
Now with the blunt ones marked as numbers, they need to be pressed in 
an order. The order that they should be pressed is 2,3,5,4,1. Konami 
expected us to be proficient pianists apparently.

      |   | |  | |   |   | |  | |  | |   |
      |   | |  | |   |   | |  | |  | |   |
      |   | |  | |   |   | |  | |  | |   |
      |   | |  | |   |   | |  | |  | |   |
      |   |1|  | |   |   | |  | |  |5|
      |   |_|  |_|   |   |_|  |_|  |_|   |
      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
      |    | 2  |    |    | 3   |4  |
            |_____|_____|____|_____|_____|____|_____|


Press them in that order and the Silver Medallion will fall from the 
precipice above the blackboard. With this in your possession, run back 
to the courtyard and place the Medallion in the hollow. But that's not 
enough!

-------------
BOILER ROOM
-------------
You must now find a place that brings 'Choking Heat'. Next stop the 
Boiler Room! Unfortunately a locked door barricades the route from the 
first floor to the basement, so we will have to take an annoying detour 
back through the second floor of the building. Go back to the second 
floor with the usual way, killing any Teddies that stumble into your 
path. Go into the hall that contains the Chemistry Lab and use the back 
door to enter the hallway. Take the hallway right down to the backside 
and go down the stairwell. Get off at the first floor and unlock the 
door that leads back into the Lobby area. Now go back down the stairs 
and enter the basement. The Storeroom on the right is locked so enter 
the boiler room. When inside, activate the red button using the 'Action 
button'. Now, the doors to the clock tower will finally open. You may 
now be closer to finding Cheryl. Once again go back to the Courtyard. 
Since you unlocked the first floor door, you can make the trip a lot 
shorter. Some Teddies may well be in this hallway now and it is a good 
thing to save you progress with the NOTEPAD that can be found in the 
INFIRMARY. When you're done, enter the clock tower with the previously 
unlocked doors. Climb own the ladder. Now, walk through the door with 
the ominous 'Keep Out' sign. Continue through the next door to enter 
part 2.2, the Alternate School.

===---===---===---===---===--
CHAPTER III: ALTERNATE SCHOOL
===---===---===---===---===--

---------------------------
THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS
---------------------------
[Now you will have some idea of why that 'Keep Out' Sign was placed 
there. The walking through the clock tower opened up some Parallel 
dimension where Harry surfaces at the courtyard of the school. On the 
floor is a worrying symbol. Things have definitely taken a turn for the 
worse, making your search for Cheryl even more frantic]

Now it's time to really get scared as some weird music starts playing. 
The doors to the lobby area are locked, but the ones that lead to the 
second floor aren't. Enter this Hallway. Some Teddies will be waiting 
to ambush you so kill them quickly. Enter the door ahead of you and 
obtain the BULLETS and the FIRST AID KIT from the benches. Also examine 
the huge fan on the wall.
Now reenter the hallway and take the next door on the left, which will 
lead to a storeroom. All you find of use in here is a PINK RUBBER BALL. 
Surely it will come in useful for something. Now look at your map and 
find the room back in the hallway on the far side. Enter the hall using 
the door on your right to be in the Hall, ignore the cockroaches and 
leave through the door on the right. Unlocking the door directly to 
your right as you enter this hallway will give easy access from the 
west hallway to the North Hallway. Now enter the single door on your 
left and pick up the PICTURE CARD from the decrepit table. The door on 
the right hand side of this classroom will lead back to the hall, but 
an obstacle is barring your path to get further down the hall. Instead, 
enter the door that leads to the adjoining classroom. Kill the 3 
TEDDIES and exit through the door to the right. You will now have 
circumvented the barricade. There is a gray door nearby, which after 
consulting the map, which will lead back to the lobby area.

-------------
THE LOBBY
-------------
There will be three Teddies waiting for you in here, 2 near you and one 
right down near reception. It's best to take the first two out now. 
Once they are dead, enter the first door on the right, which leads to 
the infirmary. The Notepad is still here and is the only save point in 
the school, so use it Now. Pick up the FIRST AID KIT from the cabinet 
and the HEALTH DRINK. Go back into the Lobby area and enter the front 
of the school, the next-door down. 

The midsection of the floor has changed into a Deep Chasm that makes 
navigating this room tricky, as there will be enemies on either side to 
trap you. Kill the one on the right quickly and go towards the front 
doors. Now take out the second Teddy. There will be an Ampoule on the 
wheelchair near the door. Pick it up then leave. Unlock the doors that 
lead to the courtyard. Now, back in lobby area, walk towards reception 
where there should be one enemy left. Cut him down quickly. Notice that 
the door leading to the next Hall is jammed, so you must take a slight 
detour through the teacher's room on the right.
Notice the gruesome remains hanging from the walls and pick up the 
BULLETS. Use the PICTURE CARD you found in the classroom on the strange 
looking door to enter the next hallway.

------------
TELEPORTERS
------------
The first door on the left is the Girl's bathroom; enter it to find 
nothing useful. Exit, and you will be mysteriously transported to the 
second floor!
Enter the boy's bathroom one door down to find an Ammo cache, which 
contains TWO BOXES OF BULLETS and some SHELLS. Now return to the girl's 
bathroom, and exit it to come back at the first floor.
NOTE: You cannot enter any other rooms on the second floor apart from 
the bathrooms.

Now, enter the Boy's bathroom that is one door down. One door is 
closed, which you should examine. Doing so, Harry will open it 
revealing a rotting carcass pin to the wall, rather like the one found 
in the alley. This unfortunate person left a SHOTGUN behind for you to 
take, which you should leave for a boss battle coming up in a while.

Nearby, you should find some writing in blood:

"Leonard Rhine: The Monster Lurks".

What could this mean?

=============
SCARY STUFF 
=============
If you look at the decomposing corpse that's pinned up inside the 
toilet stall in Self View Mode and walk towards it, a graphical glitch 
will occur, Quite a disturbing one. Concentrate on the head. Try It!!

Enter the door next up the corridor. Kill the two TEDDIES that are 
walking around inside. Enter the next door down the hall. Unusually 
enough, you will find numerous blue telephones on a desk, as well as 
some Handgun bullets that should be picked up also. Attempt to leave 
and there will be a disturbing scene.

[One of the phones will suddenly ring. On the other end is Cheryl, 
Crying for Harry. The Phone will then stop working. Interesting thing 
is, the phone was _Not Connected_...

Now leave this room.

-------------
THE ROOF
-------------
Remember to unlock the door that leads back into the Hallway opposite 
the staircase. You should now ascend the staircase. Once on the second 
floor, go up to the roof. Open the previously locked door. As the rain 
lashes down, run to the end of the roof with blood everywhere and 
examine the drainpipe. A key will be lodged in the drain, but Harry 
can't reach it. Go to the far end of the roof and examine the small 
hole. Use the BALL here. Told you it would come in useful for 
something!
This will divert the water flow past the hole and it will the drift 
into the pipe with the key. Now you need to turn on the water. Near the 
Ball will be a bright red Valve wheel that you should turn. A check of 
the pipe will reveal that the key is gone. You will be scratching your 
head wondering where the key will be, but it actually ends up in the 
courtyard in a gutter. You don't need to go there yet. Make your way 
back down to the second floor.

-----------------------
THE SECOND FLOOR
-----------------------
Now on the second floor, ignore the North hallway that led to the 
Chemistry lab and instead enter the Classroom on the right. Collect the 
BULLETS and leave. You need to enter the classroom right down from the 
one you were in previously. FOUR Teddies will be inside, as will some 
SHOTGUN SHELLS. Collect them and try and kill the TEDDIES that will 
need to be encountered again later. The classroom is quite large, so 
you may be able to run from them. Exit through the door on the right, 
using your map for directions should you come lost. Now enter the Piano 
room hallway. You can't enter the Piano room, and a TEDDY will be here. 
Kill him and enter the Lockeroom on the right. Once again there will be 
some rattling on the locker. After opening it, all you will see is 
blood. Strange. As you leave *SOMETHING HAPPENS* (I don't want to spoil 
it, It's quite a shock!). Now pick up the LIBRARY RESERVE KEY that has 
just been revealed to you.

--------------------
CASE FOR A KEY
--------------------
Leave through the hall and reenter the classroom that housed 4 TEDDIES. 
Try and run from them. Back in the second floor hall, you must take the 
stairs down to the first floor. In front of you, a bit to your right 
will be a door that led to the first hallway you came to in the 
Alternate school. It leads to the courtyard. Enter through these doors. 
There may well be a Teddy or two now in here, so kill them. Get into 
the courtyard. To the left of this door will be a gutter filled with 
water and yes, the CLASSROOM KEY. Now, with two keys in your 
possession, backtrack the way you came all the way up to the second 
floor and enter the Laboratory hallway. Were going to the library!


------------
THE LIBRARY
------------
There will be *SIGH* 2 TEDDIES inside this hall. Take them out quickly, 
they'll be on you in seconds. Pick up the HEALTH DRINK from the bench 
and enter the Library reserve. On the right hand side of the room will 
be a FIRST AID KIT on a shelf above an oddly sounding Metal Grate. You 
will also find a FILE on the shelf. Read it.

CHAPTER 3
MANIFESTATIONS OF DELUSIONS
...Poltergeists are among these.
Negative emotions, like fear, worry, or stress manifest
Into external energy with physical effects.
Nightmares have, in some cases, been shown to trigger
Them. However one such phenomena doesn't appear
To happen to just anyone. Although it's
Not clear why, adolescents, especially girls, 
Are prone to such occurrences.

Interesting.

Leave the library reserve and enter the Library. Read the book inside 
here:

Hearing this, the hunter armed with bow and arrow said, "I will kill 
the Lizard." But upon meeting his opponent, he held back, taunting, " 
Who's afraid of a Reptile". At this the furious Lizard hissed, "I'll 
swallow you in a single bite!" then, the huge creature attacked, jaws 
open wide. This was what the man wanted. Calmly drawing his bow, he 
shot into the Lizards gaping mouth. Effortlessly the arrow flew, 
piercing the defenseless maw. And the Lizard fell down dead.

Take note of what the hunter did to defeat the Lizard.
Our next destination is the basement, but some gates block the direct 
route, so you need to make another detour through some classrooms to 
defeat some _More_ Teddies. Yawn.

Enter the classroom on the right using the CLASSROOM KEY.
3 TEDDIES will be inside so try and run past them to the door on the 
other side of the room that leads to another class room. This room will 
be vacant except for a Health drink. Now, exit through the next-door 
BUT FIRST Unlock the door leading to the Lobby. Enter the Infirmary and 
SAVE YOUR GAME!!! A boss battle will be coming up!

Now go back into the previous hall and take the stairs down to the 
basement. Equip the Handgun. The door on the left is the basement 
storeroom, which you should enter first. Inside will be another AMPOULE 
and TWO BOXES OF SHELLS. Enter the boiler room, which has changed 
considerably.

In the center of the room is a Football style Turnstile and two Valve 
wheels either side of it. Turn the Right valve wheel Twice to the 
right.
Now turn the left one Once to the right. You can now get past the 
Turnstile. Go past it and you can now go down using an automatic 
elevator. 
 
***********************
BOSS 1: GIANT LIZARD
***********************
[Oh dear. Something is waiting for Harry down the bottom of the lift 
shaft. Yep, you guessed it, the very same Lizard that you read about in 
the fantasy novel upstairs. But this behemoth is VERY real, and very 
dangerous.]

---------
ATTACKS
---------
There are a few ways to defeat this overgrown salamander.
Its main attack is the lunge, which it will perform would you get 
within striking distance. Its second attack is instantly fatal, but you 
should not let this happen if you follow by guidelines.

---------
STRATEGY
---------
First blast away with the Handgun at the beasts head whilst 
backtracking around the room. After a few shots, its mouth will open a 
bit, and it will stand still for a short while. This means it's about 
to bight you. When this happens, Take out the SHOTGUN and stand in a 
position with PLENTY OF space behind you. When it gets dangerously 
close, it will open it's huge mouth and will try and swallow you hole. 
When it starts to come towards you, back up whilst holding R1 (To aim 
the Shotgun). When it opens its mouth, you should have backtracked far 
enough so it doesn't bite you. Whilst backtracking, Fire the Shotgun 
into its mouth.

-------
RESULT
-------
Once this has been done 2-5 times, The Lizard will perish and this 
brings an end to the Third section of Silent Hill. When writing this 
guide on Normal difficulty it took two blasts with it's mouth open the 
first time.

---------
REMEMBER
--------- 
DO: Use the Shotgun when the Lizard opens its mouth.
Use the Pistol to shoot its face.
Get to a place with room so that you can backtrack.

DON'T: Waste The Pistol on his mouth, this will take about 10 tries.
Stand in a corner.
GET EATEN!!!

----------------
SAYANARA SCHOOL!
----------------
[When the Lizard dies, Harry's view of events will fade and go blurry.
Harry will then wake up in the basement of the real school. Harry is 
not alone. A ghostly apparition of a young woman wearing a Blue dress 
appears in the room, and then vanishes. Who is she? The Girl Harry hit 
on the road? Weird. Who is she? Harry will find out soon! Although 
Harry has survived the school, he still hasn't found Cheryl but maybe 
someone else will be able to give him some sort of a clue]

There will now be a key lying on the floor of the basement. Take the K. 
Gordon key and leave the boiler room. After exiting the stairs, Harry 
will hear a church bell. The Church is on Bloch Street, but the roads 
leading there are blocked. Harry must somehow find another way there. 
Get back to the lobby area, saving the game at the Infirmary if 
necessary. Now, get to the reception and check out the register. 
Apparently, K. Gordon was a teacher at the school and Harry will then 
mark his house on the map Leave through the LOCKED front doors. You 
will now be at Chapter IV.

===---===---===---===---===---==
CHAPTER IV: CENTRAL SILENT HILL
===---===---===---===---===---==
[After exiting the school, Harry makes his priority getting to the 
church and finding Cheryl. Perhaps the person ringing the bell knows. 
One thing is for sure; Harry is not alone in Silent Hill. Note that 
this section mainly takes place in Old Silent Hill, but carves out a 
route too central Silent Hill. Oh yeah, It's daylight out as well.]

----------------
BRADBURY STREET
----------------
Leaving the front of the School, you should get back onto Midwich 
Street, but stay on the school side though. A short distance from the 
school, down the bottom of Bradbury will be a school bus. Enter it 
through the side door. You can't drive it unfortunately, there are 
cobwebs everywhere suggesting it's not been used for years. That's odd.
Anyway, there will be two HEALTH DRINKS on the second seat and a 
NOTEPAD near the back. Take your leave from the bus and head down 
Bradbury Street. Head up the alley towards K. Gordon's house using your 
map for directions. Once at his house, use the HANDGUN on the dog and 
enter through the back door. There's no health drinks here, so enter 
through the back door, using the K. Gordon key.

=============
WEIRD STUFF 
=============
On Bradbury Street, on the left hand side are posters for the movie Pet 
Semetary.

--------------------
K. GORDON HOUSE
--------------------
There are TWO BOXES OF BULLETS and a notepad at his house plus a 
NOTEPAD. Now leave the house. You'll now be in lower LEVIN STREET.
Look at the map and switch back onto Bradbury Street, where you should 
head left keeping on the left hand side pavement. As it turns into an 
alleyway, you'll find a HEALTH DRINK on the bench. If you didn't use 
much at the school, you should have quite a stock now. Head up the 
alley way and just about halfway up, on the right hand side near some 
trashcans is a box of BULLETS. Collect them and head out onto Bloch 
Street. Run off down Bloch street and just past BACHMAN ROAD is the 
Church. Go inside for a Cinematic.

================
TRIVIA
================

------------------
BLOCH STREET
------------------
[Inside will be a lady, who will later be revealed to be Dahlia 
Gillespie. She urges you to get to the Hospital. Although she appears 
like a bit of a Quack, she does leave you with a bunch of goodies on 
the altar.]

When Gillespie leaves, approach the altar and take the "FLAUROS", The 
DRAWBRIDGE KEY and the HEALTH DRINK near the door. Exit by the door you 
came in. keeping on the right hand side of Bloch Street, run along a 
while and you will come across a garage. A DOG will guard it, so kill 
it and enter the Garage. Behind the SUV will be a NOTEPAD and a 
GASOLINE TANKE (If your playing Next Fear Mode), and round the side 
will be some BULLETS. Pick them all up and leave. At the end of Bloch 
Street, is the Ellroy intersection. Take Ellroy Street down, and head 
round the back of the garage where you should pick up all the bullets 
and shells. Head back onto Bloch Street and pace towards the 
Drawbridge. Before you go to far onto the bridge, head to the left hand 
side and walk down the steps where a FIRST AID KIT will be waiting. Now 
head to the drawbridge and Enter through the door at the top of the 
staircase. Once inside, pick up the HEALTH DRINK and locate the control 
panel. Use the DRAWBRIDGE KEY and leave the place. Head back onto the 
bridge that has now been lowered and bid Old Silent Hill farewell. 

===========
TRIVIA
===========
Throughout town, the newspaper boxes contain a newspaper with the 
headline "Bill Skins Fifth"-The exact same newspaper and headline from 
"The Silence of the Lambs". They can be seen easily in Self View Mode, 
which can be unlocked upon completion of the game. Furthermore, there 
is an actual newspaper in the Drawbridge Control Tower. If you've seen 
the movie, it's worth a look.

------------------------------
CENTRAL SILENT HILL
------------------------------
[Finally were out of Old Silent Hill and a little closer to finding 
Cheryl. Following the advice of the woman at the church, you should 
make your way to the hospital. Be wary though as a new monster, The 
Apeman is out to get you.]

Once the game loads, run to your left and pick up the Solitary HEALTH 
DRINK from the Oil Drum near the Shack. Cross back over to the right 
hand side and run along until you see another set of stairs, which 
leads to some AMMO. Pick it up and head into town. Look at your map and 
find Crichton Street, follow it down and head left onto Koontz Street, 
where you will find the gates of ALCHEMILLA HOSPITAL. Notice the rather 
loud gunshots. Take the Two dogs out with the Handgun and enter the 
front of the hospital, using the double doors.

===---===---===---===---===---==
CHAPTER V: ALCHEMILLA HOSPITAL
===---===---===---===---===---==
[Now that we've made it to the hospital, hopefully our search for 
Cheryl will be finally justified. Who knows what awaits Harry in this 
Hospital?]

------------------
RECEPTION
------------------
First, get the Hospital Map that's displayed on the wall. Head round 
the corridor, taking note of yet another gunshot. The door on the left 
hand side is the only one that opens so head through and brace yourself 
for an encounter with Dr.Kaufmann.

[Despite nearly shooting you, Dr.Kaufmann seems friendly enough and is 
oblivious to what's going on. He hasn't a clue where Cheryl is, but 
tells you to look for an escape route. You concur, and Kaufmann leaves 
hurriedly.]
 Your now alone in the EXAMINATION ROOM. There's nothing of interest 
here, but there are two doors. Use the one on the left to end up in an 
office like area. Use the next door to end up back in the Reception 
area, but round the other side of the counter. It's a Hospital, so it's 
likely you'll find many FIRST AID KITS lying around. And there is one 
on the bench. Take it and use the NOTEPAD if you feel a little 
cautious. Now, lets get back to the Examination Room and use the only 
door we haven't entered yet. This Medicine room is useless as well, so 
head on out using the next door to end up in a corridor. The doors in 
front of you and the one to your right cannot be opened. Stop Sulking. 
Instead, go into the third door that will lead to the DOCTOR'S OFFICE. 
A quick search of this area will reveal a BASEMENT MAP.

--------------------
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE 
--------------------
 Now, use the door to get into the adjacent room. On the large table 
will be a BASEMENT KEY, which you should Pocket before returning to the 
hallway. Enter the next-door down and you'll end up in a small kitchen. 
Amongst the grimy pots and pans will be a HEALTH DRINK. Inspect the 
cluster of transparent bottles near the sink area. Take the PLASTIC 
BOTTLE. I'm sure it will come in handy. Leave and enter the Next door. 
This is the DIRECTOR'S OFFICE. A quick peek behind the desk shows that 
someone has smashed a vial of pink liquid on the marble floor. Inspect 
it. Well, it's not there for no reason, so we'd better scoop it up with 
the PLASTIC BOTTLE. Told ya it would come in handy. Now that we have 
the Basement Key and The Basement Map, It's only right that we should 
now investigate the Basement.

-----------------
BASEMENT
-----------------
The Stairwell leading to the Basement is just past the director's 
office. Just after that is a pair of inactive vending machines and an 
ornate Elevator that is out of action. Enter the final door using the 
BASMENT KEY, and descend the staircase to the bottom. Emerging at the 
Basement, you'll discover that the place is infested with giant 
cockroaches. They are easily avoidable so don't start shooting like a 
madman. We need to conserve our precious ammunition for later stages. 
To cut a long story short, the only unlocked door is the one to your 
right. Enter it and you'll find yourself in a Generator Room. Press the 
switch on the generator to restore power to most parts of the Hospital, 
and this will also enable the use of the Lift. Instead of heading to 
the first floor, head past that door to find the Elevator. Get inside 
and use the Control Panel to head to Floor 2. After leaving the 
elevator, try and use the door. Dammn. Doesn't open. We'll have to0 
find another way round. Get back to the elevator and get back to Floor 
3. Get off and try and use this door. No Luck. Well, this is fun isn't 
it! Head back to the Elevator and Inspect the Control panel VERY 
CAREFULLY. Now, for some insane reason, a fourth floor has 
materialized. But in an insane world such as this, this is one of the 
sanest things you've seen yet. Take the elevator up to the Fourth Floor 
and get off. Watch the scene of the girl you saw back at the school 
generator room, She seems to be entering the antique shop. Things have 
changed; the once nicely decorated floors of the hospital have morphed 
into grimy, ugly corridors. It probably smells, too. So lets see if 
this door opens. Success! 
 
===---===---===---===---=
VI: ALTERNATE HOSPITAL
===---===---===---===---=
[Things have taken a familiar turn for the worse. If Cheryl is here 
somewhere, this will make your search all the more frantic.]

----------------
THE THIRD FLOOR 
----------------
Note, For the most of the Alternate Hospital, we will be working to 
find Alice in wonderland Plates. There are four required to get us to 
the next area, so don't worry about them for now.
Walk forwards a small way and the door will lock behind you. Don't 
bother trying the doors you see here. They don't open, and lets face 
it, I don't want to open them. Instead carry on until the corridor ends 
and use the final door, and do exactly the same in the next room. In 
this final corridor, is another stairwell. Take it down to the THIRD 
FLOOR. The Hospital will now be overrun with Zombie Nurses. For now, 
the Shotgun and Or Handgun will work best, so shoot the first Nurse 
dead and enter the first door on the right. In this bathroom is a PLATE 
OF TURTLE. Take it and leave, and now consult your map to find ROOM 302 
where there is a NOTEPAD you can use. Actually, you probably should use 
it. Room 304 is our next destination. Kill the Nurse quickly and pick 
up the HEALTH DRINK. Opposite the staircase you entered from is the 
LINEN ROOM that you should now enter. Get out using the next door. Kill 
the two NURSES that linger here and enter the first door. In this 
STOREROOM is a FIRST AID KIT, A box of BULLETS and importantly, a BLOOD 
PACK. Now, we'll go to room 306. Once inside take the PLATE OF CAT. 
Rooms 307 and 305 cannot be entered. Sorry. That's all we can do now on 
the THIRD FLOOR, So it might be an idea to start on the FIRST FLOOR.

-----------------
THE FIRST FLOOR
-----------------
Get back to the Stairwell Via the Linen Room and take it right down to 
the bottom and use the door. Once back at the third floor, take down 
the ZOMBIE DOCTOR and use the next door that leads to the next hall. 
Kill yet more ZOMBIE DOCTORS and reenter the KITCHEN, where there is a 
HEALTH DRINK guarded by a DOCTOR. Now get back to the Director's OFFICE 
where you should find the PLATE OF QUEEN and a SAVE POINT. Now head for 
the SECOND FLOOR. 

-----------------
THE SECOND FLOOR
----------------
Once back at the second floor, Take down the two NURSES and enter the 
first door on the right, Room 201. Pick up the OIL LIGHTER and make 
your exit. The final room of this corridor, Room 204 contains some 
bloodthirsty tentacles that are blocking your access to The PLATE OF 
HATTER. Use the BLOOD PACK you acquired in the Third Floor Storeroom to 
nourish this ravenous life form and take the Fourth and Final PLATE. 
Now head back into the hall and find the NURSES CENTER. Get inside and 
notice the scribble on the wall. After reading that, look at the Door.

Each hole represents a hollow where a Plate should be placed.

First Hollow: PLATE OF TURTLE 
Second Hollow: PLATE OF HATTER 
Third Hollow: PLATE OF CAT 
Fourth Hollow: PLATE OF QUEEN

Now that the door is unlocked, you should enter the next hall. The 
first door you see, you should enter. There are two Nurses here that 
will try to ambush you, so take them down quickly and enter the 
adjacent room. Pick up the Basement Storage Key, doing your best not to 
interrupt the NURSE. The Next room down from this Room is ICU, which 
you should now enter. Take the DISINFECTING ALCOHOL and leave. This 
time, enter ROOM 206 and pick up the FIRST AID KIT. Were almost done on 
this floor. 

--------------------
THE PROPER BASMENT
--------------------
Take the Next Double doors that lead to the Lift. Take it down to the 
basement. Once you're off enter the Generator room and pick up the 
HAMMER that should be used to take down the nurses that remain. Get to 
the BASEMENT STOREROOM and use the BASEMENT STOREROOM KEY to get 
inside. Check the Cabinet at the back for scratch marks and move it out 
of the way. Use the hidden door. In this new a real, check the trapdoor 
at the back. It seems some Plants have coiled round the Trapdoor. Use 
the ALCOHOL and then The LIGHTER to destroy this obstacle, and now go 
down the passage that as been revealed. Use the door at the end. There 
are p0lenty of doors in this darkened hall, but only the one on the 
left will open. Use it, avoiding the 2 NURSES. In this hall, avoid yet 
more nurses and use the last door on the left. This looks like a 
child's room to me. Take the EXAMINATION ROOM KEY from the panel and 
inspect the Picture. Alessa? Leave the Basement and get back to the 
FIRST FLOOR. Once there, kill the DOCTORS with the HAMMER and enter the 
Medicine room (Using your map if necessary.), where there is yet 
another DOCTOR. Take him down and use the Examination Room Key to meet 
a new friend, Lisa.

===---===---===---===---===---===---===---=
CHAPTER VII: ALTERNATE CENTRAL SILENT HILL
===---===---===---===---===---===---===---=
[Lisa seems rather pleased to see you, but you can hardly blame her. 
Although she hasn't seen Cheryl, she does appear to be on your side. 
Your conversation is cut short however as Harry awakens in the 
Examination room, back in the Good Hospital. It seems Harry's search 
will never be over. Just then, the old lady from the Church, Dahlia 
Gillespie arrives and urges you to get to the other Church. Wherever 
that is, Cheryl Must be. You really haven't got anything else to go on, 
so that's where we must go.]

-----------------------
EXAMINATION ROOM
-----------------------
Once Dahlia leaves the examination room, check the desk near the door 
to find the ANTIQUE SHOP KEY. Head out into the Reception area and take 
a look at the payphones and Harry will note down the location of the 
ANTIQUE SHOP. This is where we'll head next, but before you leave it 
would be a good idea to use the NOTEPAD. Back in the courtyard, waste 
the two ZOMBIE DOGS if you didn't earlier and leave through the gates.

-------------------
KOONTZ STREET 
-------------------
Follow Koontz Street down towards Simmons street, keeping on the left 
hand side. After a while you'll pass a short alley, where you'll be 
able to find some BULLETS and a HEALTH DRINK. Avoid any nasties that 
are flying around and rejoin Koontz Street, this time going up to 
SIMMONS STREET. Just before Koontz Street turns onto Simmons Street, 
check out the cafe, where a HEALTH DRINK lies in wait. Take it and head 
up Simmons street. There really is nothing to find here, just avoid all 
enemies and run for your life right to the top of Simmons Street where 
you should find the Antique Shop. The Front doors are invitingly open, 
I see. Walk down the stone steps and use the ANTIQUE SHOP KEY to get 
inside the Shop proper.

=============
TRIVIA
=============
On the opposite side of Simmons Street to where the Antique Shop is, 
You'll find posters for the movie Carrie. A little way back down the 
road, and you'll find the plant shop from "Little Shop Of Horrors".

-------------------
ANTIQUE SHOP
-------------------
As soon as you enter, you'll see a NOTEPAD on the counter. In the back 
walk of the shop is a cabinet. Approach it and press action. Move the 
Cabinet to reach a secret alcove. As you go to investigate, Cybil stops 
you. Instead of reporting reinforcements, she tells you that her route 
back to Brahms was cut short. Cars have stopped running. She also 
deduces that Dahila must be high. But even better news is that she saw 
Cheryl heading for the Lake. She must be around there. But first we'll 
investigate this alcove. Continue through this dark passage until you 
enter another chamber, which must be the "Other" Church that Dahlia 
mentioned. Investigate the altar to find mysterious white powder there. 
Look at the wall and you'll find the rather useless Axe. Pick it up and 
attempt to leave. Harry will be again haunted by another vision. He's 
now I the Hospital where he talks to Lisa. She'll talk about Dahlia and 
the history of the town. Just then, you'll reawaken at the Antique 
Shop. The wooden floor has changed to a metal walkway and on the floor 
is yet another disturbing symbol. Use the Notepad if you feel like it 
and head on out.

------------------------
SILENT HILL TOWN CENTER
------------------------
This is quite a hard part, as you may well end up getting completely 
lost. To have an idea of our destination, look at your map and find 
SILENT HILL TOWN CENTER. It's a very short distance down from the 
Antique Shop. Unfortunately, Apemen and Dogs are out in force so be 
careful. It's probably better to just run. Anyway, head for SILENT HILL 
TOWN CENMTER, staying close to the buildings on the left hand side. 
When you get there, the camera will change focusing on a hole in the 
shutter. Get inside this hole to enter the TOWN CENTER, Aka the 
shopping Mall. The ground floor is completely blocked as the floor has 
caved in. Instead head for the escalators, which are disabled. As you 
try to ascend the escalator, you'll get a short cutscene. Head up to 
the top and bear left where you'll find the Jewelry Shop. Inside this 
Shop, find the RIFLE SHELLS on the display case and use the NOTEPAD. 
His is recommended, as there is an upcoming battle. Head back outside 
the shop and head left past the shop, where you'll see a corpse 
infested with Cockroaches. As you get closer the floor collapses and 
Harry ends up in a Sandpit. This is our Second Boss, The Larvae.

******************* 
BOSS 2: LARVAE
******************* 

------------
ATTACKS
------------
The Larvae will burrow its way underneath the sand and will then spring 
up and attack you by spraying venomous clouds at you. Fortunately, this 
isn't very wounding, so don't worry about being hurt TOO much, just 
simply keep looking back at your Inventory screen and use a HEALTH 
DRINK if necessary. Unfortunately, the Larvae will usually sproing up 
from behind to catch you off guard. This is bad as it usually results 
in a hit, and the Larvae will usually get back underground before you 
have a chance to shoot him.

------------
STRATEGY
------------
The best way to go is to back yourself into the corners of this arena 
with the Shotgun loaded. When you hear it burrow out, shoot it with the 
Shotgun.

----------
RESULT
----------
After a few direct hits, the Larvae will be defeated and will leave the 
Sandpit.

----------
REMEMBER
----------
DO Use The Shotgun, The Handgun is too weak. Melee weapons are next to 
useless.

------------------
SAGAN STREET
------------------
After the Larvae is defeated, Pick up the HUNTING RIFLE from the 
display case in the Sandpit. Now head out through the glass that the 
Larvae broke when it fled. As your map indicates, your now round the 
back of the Mall. It's infested with Flying Demons so beware. Make your 
way down the small road and head on round the corner to get to Sagan 
Street. Run down Sagan Street, keeping firmly on the right hand side of 
the road, and enter the POLICE STATION that's right at the end. Once 
inside, Pick Up the RIFLE SHELLS and some more ammunition. There is 
also a NOTEPAD here. Now, our next destination is the Hospital. Head 
back down Crichton Streer until you get to the Koontz intersection. 
Take KOONTZ a short way down and enter the Hospital. Two Ravenous Dogs 
may be here, so run straight for the front door of the Hospital. Head 
round the coridoor and enter the EXAMINATION ROOM for a short 
Conversation with Lisa. It seems the only way to get to the lake is an 
old waterworks by the elementary school. Now leave the Hospital through 
the front door, but before you do so, make sure you use the NOTEPAD at 
the Reception desk. And now then exit through the gate. It seems things 
have definitely changed and the only place left to go is across the 
street, up to the WATER TOWER. Take the stairs up to the roof and 
prepare for another boss fight.

==========
NOTE
==========
In the front yard of the hospital, you can use the Channeling Stone.

******************* 
BOSS 3: GIANT MOTH
*******************
The Larvae has evolved into a Huge Moth that hovers in the air waiting 
to kill Harry. The first roof your on is no good. Instead, head up the 
next staircase to get to the actual Water Tower. It is this arena where 
you will kill this beast.

----------------
ATTACKS
----------------
The Moth will hover around attempting to hit you with his tail or, 
throwing a cloud of poison at you. Getting hit is inevitable, usually 
so constantly check on your status and use a HEALTH DRINK. You should 
have quite a stockpile now, so don't be afraid to use them.

--------------
STRATEGY
--------------
Although the Shotgun works well, I prefer to use the RIFLE on this 
boss. Simply run to a corner of the roof and fire a few bursts at him. 
Then run to another corner to evade his Venom and repeat. 

-------------
RESULT
-------------
After a While, The Moth will fall from the sky, which is now turning 
back to daylight.

----------
REMEMBER
----------
DO Use the Rifle. You should have enough ammo now.
DO Use The Shotgun if you prefer. It does the job but a bit slower.
DON'T try to use the Knife or other such weapons. I would have thought 
this would be obvious.

--------------------
POLICE STATION
--------------------
Although the police station was unlocked all this time, if you followed 
my guide you shouldn't have been there yet. Anyway, the Moth is gone 
and won't be coming back, so relax. Head down from the Water Tower and 
get back onto Crichton Street. Run back to the top and beware of the 
APEMEN. The Police Station is right on the corner. Get inside 
immediately. On the Desk will be some HANDGUN BULLETS and some shells 
for your Shotgun. If you use the door to the left, you'll be inside the 
DETECTIVE'S OFFICE. You should find this scribbled on a piece of paper:

Coroner Seals called. Officer Gucci unlikely 
To be murdered. He apparently died naturally.
But medical records show Officer Gucci
Had no prior symptoms of Heart disease

And This on the Blackboard:

Product only available in
Select areas of Silent Hill.
Raw material is White Claudia,
A plant peculiar to the region.
Manufactured here?
Dealer=Manufacturer?

This gives yet more clues as to what Cybil was talking about. Also, 
Officer Gucci may have been killed by the Cult. Remember what Lisa 
said?

Okay, were done with Central Silent Hill for good now. But we do have 
to take a detour through OLD SILENT HILL to get to the RESORT.

----------
NOTE
----------
If you missed the Shotgun back at the School, It will appear at the 
Police Station, or so I'm told.

CHAPTER VIII: SEWAGE SYSTEM
===---===---===---===---===-
[This is too much with no sign of Cheryl yet, Harry must begin to 
wonder when he will ever find his daughter. Both places Dahlia 
suggested have proven to be red herrings. Can she be trusted? On this 
evidence not really. But what else do we have to go on? Who is this 
Girl In Blue that haunts Harry's Nightmarish visions? Just what the 
hell is going on! Lisa did suggest however that The Lake could be 
reached with the Waterworks by her old elementary school. It's a long 
walk back from the Police Station however. Somehow, Cheryl must be in 
the Resort.]

-----------------
WATERWORKS
-----------------
Leave the Police Station and head back over the bridge into OLD SILENT 
HILL. Say a brief goodbye to the madness of CENTRAL SILENT HILL, too. 
Lol.
When the game loads after going over the bridge, you'll be right 
outside the Waterworks. Clever guys at Konami, Huh?
At the waterworks, press action at the gate. Locked. Wait a minute, a 
Padlock. I bet it would snap off if hit hard enough. Any of your Melee 
weapons will snap it off, so snap it and enter the Waterworks. Use the 
Trapdoor you find there and lets get moving.

VOICE ACTORS

---------------
SEWER A
---------------
The sewers are dank, dismal and smelly. And are also home to a new 
brand of monster, that I've called the "Clickers". Be wary of these new 
annoying beasts. There is no map to this area so try and follow my 
vague directions. In this first tunnel, simply head forwards until it 
ends, branching off left to right. We'll need to go right a lot later 
on, but for now we'll head left. After a while, this path forks left 
and right also. Stay on the left hand side and cross over using the 
plank. Now, keep right and cross back over the water. Go round the 
corner and you'll come to a gate. Continue through this passage right 
to the end to find a desk. Pick up the SEWER KEY and use the NOTEPAD if 
you wish. Now, find the next gate nearby and use it to leave this 
Office. Now you'll be back near where you came in to this 
passage/Office area.

Now, If you'll excuse my rather awful map of the SEWER, you may be able 
to find where were able to go next. By looking at the map, you'll get a 
brief outline of where we must now go. So, now, go down to where the 
ITEMS are, Some BULLETS, RIFLE SHELLS and a HEALTH DRINK and head back 
to the Sewer Exit, using the KEY TO escape. Relax; Sewer B is much 
easier to navigate.

---------------
SEWER B
---------------
From where you start, bear left and pick up the FIRST AID KIT and then 
turn back and head due south (Look at your map. Try to get to the long 
corridor that heads right.). Once at the start of this long passage run 
down as far as you can. Beware of the evil Ceiling Clickers who want to 
decapitate you. When the tunnel ends, you'll see another archway to 
your right. Ignore it for a time being and go further past it and pick 
up the HEALTH DRINK and BULLETS. Now go back to the arch and head down 
this tunnel. To the left will be a locked gate and to the left will be 
a very long tunnel. Head through the gate with "Keep Out" Scrawled on a 
plate. Head through this tunnel, past numerous gates and soon you'll 
get to a dead end. In the water though is a section filled with blood. 
Examine this and you'll find the SEWER EXIT KEY. Pick it up, and 3 
CLICKERS will ambush you. But this is laughably easy to circumnavigate, 
Just Quick turn (R2+L2) and run back all the way to the gate that was 
locked. Beware of more Clickers and use the SEWER EXIT KEY to gain 
access to the end of SEWER B. You'll find a NOTEPAD lying on a barrel. 
You may use it if you wish, but there are still plenty lying around the 
RESORT AREA. Use the ladder here, and we'll finally get to the RESORT. 
Boy, I HATE the Sewers.

===---===---===---===---===-
CHAPTER IX: LAKESIDE RESORT
===---===---===---===---===-
[Maybe now Harry will be able to find Cheryl and get out of this place. 
This is the only place Cheryl could now be. It's make or break time.]

This is the first Flag point that needs to be met in order to secure 
the Best ending. If you prefer to get either the Bad or Bad+ Ending you 
should skip this part and go to the "Sandford Street" Section. The 
second Flag point is further on in the game.

---------------
ANNIE'S BAR 
---------------
After finally getting out of that blasted sewer, you'll surface inside 
some ruins. Unfortunately it's gotten dark now, so turn your torch on. 
Search all of the immediate area inside these ruins, as there is a lot 
to pick up. RIFLE SHELLS and FIRST AID KITS are amongst the goodies. 
Now, you must head for the road. This is Bachman Road, but we won't be 
able to get back to OLD SILENT HILL. On the road, on the side by the 
dilapidated building is a sign that contains the RESORT Map. Pick this 
up right now. Head down Bachman Road, keeping to the left hand side 
until the fence you are following turns into a Car Park. At this point, 
head there and approach the front door to enter Annie's Bar. Inside 
you'll see Dr. Kaufmann being attacked by a Demonic Teddy. Harry will 
kill this beast and Kaufmann will talk to Harry. It seems both of you 
haven't been able to come up with an escape route yet and Kaufmann then 
leaves in a big Hurry. Anyway, investigate the area around the Snooker 
tables to find an Orange Object on the floor. It's Kaufmann's Wallet 
and it's full of stuff. A Store Receipt with the numbers "0473" 
Scribbled on there is inside and so is a KAUFMANN KEY. Now search the 
front of the bar to find some HEALTH DRINKS and a NOTEPAD. It's best to 
use this NOTEPAD. Now leave the Bar.

=================
INTERESTING STUFF
=================
You know, it's not necessary to go to the Indian Runner. You could 
alternatively skip that part and head to the Motel using the code 0886 
to enter. Unless you want to be thorough, you could consider this an 
option.

------------------
INDIAN RUNNER 
------------------
I don't know what an Indian Runner is. A store of some sorts, 
apparently. But this is where the receipt came from, so I'm sure there 
will be something of significance up there. Look at the map and find 
the INDIAN RUNNER, just off CRAIG STREET. From the car park, head 
through the trees on your left and get to the INDIAN RUNNER. By this 
time there may well be several enemies on your tail. Find the Lock and 
input the Code, 0473 to unlock the door. Get inside. You'll find that 
the place has been completely trashed. Take the RIFLE SHELLS and head 
round the counter. Open the drawer to find the SAFE KEY. Then pick up 
the HELATH DRINK and examine the DIARY on the Counter.

It reads:

August 20
He came by. I handed over the package
That the woman left here.
September 12
He showed up at Norman's too.
Don't want to be involved
With the likes of them anymore, but...
I'm getting creeped out even more
Than before. Thought of leaving 
Town, but I'm afraid of what will happen if I do.

Now read the Shopping list on the wall.

3 Loaves of bread
3 cartons of Milk
2-dozen eggs
Deliver to back door
Daily 8 a.m.
Rear entrance code 0886
Norman Young

Could That Woman be Dahlia?

Now use the SAFE KEY on the Safe to find some drugs. Harry doesn't want 
a snort, though. Now you have the combination to Norman's Motel (0886), 
head there. 

===========
NOTE
===========
The drugs cannot be taken. I would have thought that was obvious.

---------------
NORMAN'S MOTEL
---------------
Take Weaver Street down, but keep yourself to the right hand side. 
Eventually you should see the door on your right. Examine the door and 
use the code on the shopping list to get inside. On the Desk is a 
notebook:

September 10
Took package.
Told to sit on it a while.
Don't want to get involved but
Can't disobey...
He's probably linked to 
The death of the mayor and others.

Take the MAGNET from the Settee and read the PAPER. Sometimes you wont 
be able to read it, don't ask me why.

INVESTIGATION STALLED
"PTV" Dealers still at large.

Suspicious deaths continue.
Like the anti-drug mayor, 
A narcotics officer dies of 
Sudden heart failure of
Origin unknown.

It's quite obvious this is about Officer Gucci, The cop you read about 
at the Police Station.
Go through the next door into the main Motel area. Use the NOTEPAD if 
you feel so inclined and head out through the front door. We need to 
find ROOM 3. Once located, use the KAUFMANN KEY to enter. Get inside 
and notice the chest of drawers that's been moved. Look at it closer 
and you'll see that some careless soul has dropped a key down there. 
Use your MAGNET to retrieve the MOTORCYCLE KEY (No, You can't drive 
it.) and before you return to the Living room, check out the shower to 
find a HEALTH DRINK. Once back at Norman's Living Room, enter the one 
door we haven't been through to get to The Garage. Surprise, surprise 
there's a Bike. Before we examine it, pick up the SHOTGUN SHELLS. Now, 
use the MOTORCYCLE KEY to find a vial similar to the one you found 
destroyed at the Hospital. Then, Dr. Kaufmann enters and snatches it 
away from you. Whatever that liquid is, it's bound to be important, 
bear that in mind. Well, that was a waste of time. Wasn't it? The last 
place to go now is Sanford Street, and that's where we'll go.

===========
NOTE
===========
You can use the Channeling Stone in the area that contains the Motel 
Apartments.

-----------------
SANDFORD STREET
-----------------
Head out through the door and take Weaver Street down until it ends. 
Now take Sanford Street down, keeping firmly on the left hand side, 
near the waterfront. Halfway down Sanford Street is a small staircase 
with some AMMO and HEALING SUPPLIES. Head back down Sanford Street 
until we get to a cutscene. The Permanent Darkness may have occurred. 
Gulp. The place is infested with monsters now, so you'll want to be 
very swift. Ignore everything; there's nothing to pick up. Instead, 
head down West Sanford Street, passing the east and west Garages. After 
the West Garage, head down this short path until you see some steps 
leading to the water. Follow this to a HOUSEBOAT, being wary of the 
DOGS. Enter the HOUSEBOAT. You'll find a body hooked up to the 
bulkhead. Continue to the door at the end and enter the Control Area of 
the HOUSEBOAT. You'll have a brief cinema with Cybil. Dahlia enters and 
warns that you must go to the Lighthouse and to the Amusement Park. 
Cybil hasn't a clue what's going on, so she decides to go to the 
Amusement Park while you go to the Lighthouse. We'll need to use the 
"Flauros" Apparently.

==========
NOTE
==========
You can use the Channeling Stone inside the Houseboat. Notice how the 
uses are becoming more frequent.

--------------
LIGHTHOUSE
--------------
Once we are alone in the Houseboat, take your time to pick up the 
HANDGUN BULLETS, RIFLE SHELLS and the HEALTH DRINK. Oh, and do use the 
NOTEPAD as well. This next section is extremely complicated to explain, 
and the map will do you no good. So head out through the door Dahlia 
went to and head down the end of the platform. Walk down the stairs at 
the end and cross over the planks. Continue on this path until you can 
cross over another Plank. Then go past the barrel through the open 
gate. Go up some stairs to your left and head down some more stairs on 
the opposite side. Go for a while on this path tom find some more 
stairs that you should use. Get to the top, avoid the DOGS and get to 
the Lighthouse. He he, this is familiar. There's a NOTEPAD Here too, so 
when your finished head up this loopy spiral until you reach the top. 
It seems Alessa has beaten you up here. Leave the Lighthouse and walk 
back in the direction to the HOUSEBOAT. The nice chaps at Konami have 
again got rid of a boring bit and enabled you to get back to the 
houseboat without too much hassle. Cybil didn't come back, so now we 
must look for her. Use the NOTEPAD and head out through the doors and 
rejoin SANFORD STREET. Beware of the numerous baddies that are roaming 
the streets. There's not much point in battling them, so just run. 
Cross to the other side of the road to find a fenced off area, where 
the gate is open. Cybil must have got here. Use the Manhole to enter 
SEWER C. Gulp. As you go down you'll see a brief FMV of Cybil getting 
attacked.

========
NOTE
========
The final place that the Stone can be used is at the Lighthouse. If you 
use it here and have used it at all previous locations, the game will 
now end.

---------------
SEWER C
---------------
You'll find another strange symbol on the floor. Ignore it and pick up 
the SEWER C map from the right hand wall and head on through this first 
section of the sewer. When this path ends, it will end up at another 
one, heading south. Follow this right down to the end and pick up the 
HEALTH DRINKS and AMMO. Now double back to the path-leading east and 
kill all the beasts here. Especially the Teddies, as they are very 
dangerous this time round. They can catch up in seconds so once they 
are down make sure they STAY down. Now continue until this path ends 
and take a left. When you start to see carousel horses, you'll be 
getting very close to the AMUSEMENT PARK. Use the ladder here.

----------------------------
THE LAKESIDE AMUSEMENT PARK
----------------------------
Since there is no map for the amusement park, you're going to have to 
be very careful. The Concessions stand is where we need to make for, so 
look at all the rides. The Concessions stand is opposite the big wheel. 
Save the Game here and notice the Black Baby's. Now, head to the 
Carousel. Turn around and head forwards. Then go left until you find 
the Carousel. Enter through the gate and you'll get a Cut Scene.
It seems Cybil has been overtaken by a parasite of some kind. When the 
cut scene ends, Cybil will attempt to strangle you. When she gets very 
close, use the RED LIQUID you found at the Hospital on Cybil to stop 
her in her tracks. If you can't get her with the Liquid, run around her 
and use it. Be careful, as she's a little trigger-happy; so if she 
pulls her sidearm out, run. Once she is soaked in the Liquid, you'll 
get a few cut scenes. 

**************
BOSS 4: CYBIL
**************
If you soak Her in the liquid, the parasite will escape. Harry will 
then stomp on it. If the above method is used, then you'll get the best 
ending. If you kill her, you'll get the Good + Ending. It's advised 
that you save her as it's easier, and you'll get the better rewards at 
the end.

If you decide to kill her, use the following method.
Cybil's first attack is the slap. She'll walk forwards and slap you. 
This is usually followed with her shooting at you. Her shots are easily 
avoided, so just run a bit away when she pulls her gun out. You need 
her to shoot at you so she runs out of ammo. She'll then throw the gun 
away, and will attempt to strangle you. If she does, repeatedly bash 
all four buttons to stop her. Prolonged strangulation will result in 
death for Harry. If she shoots you, you'll fall to the floor. If this 
happens, mash X as she'll usually walk forwards and put another bullet 
in your brain. Anyway, once she disposes of her weapon, pull out the 
Handgun and fire away at her until she dies.

Now, hopefully you didn't kill Cybil.

Harry and Cybil will then sit down on the Carousel, and then Harry will 
confess that Cheryl was found by the side of the road, and she's not 
his real daughter. He deduces that there must be some connection 
between her and this town (Well, Duh). Harry will then leave Cybil 
alone and confronts Alessa, who pummels Harry with inhuman strength. 
Then, The "Flauros" Will appear and attacks Alessa. Dahlia then enters 
and a blue light envelops the both of them. 

===---===---===---===---=
CHAPTER X: NOWHERE
===---===---===---===---=
[It now seems that Dahlia is the enemy and she must be stopped. 
Wherever Harry is, He's clueless. He awakens to find Lisa with him in a 
room that resembles the Examination Room. This whole area is made up of 
new areas and ones from Harry's past. This has to be the final chapter 
of Silent Hill, and this is the last place Cheryl could be. Lisa, on 
the other hand seems to be losing it. She soon disappears, leaving 
Harry alone.]

---------------
NOWHERE
---------------
As Lisa Leaves, you may want to use the NOTEPAD on the desk. Then leave 
for there is nothing else here. You'll now be on a catwalk that leads 
to an elevator, where Harry will be summoned. Harry will automatically 
enter the elevator and will drop you off on the first floor, NOTE that 
the elevator cannot be re entered. Continue down this short hall and 
find the third door to your right. Notice the ghostly Cheryl. This room 
is the antique shop from Central Silent Hill. If you look at the clock, 
you'll find that the hands are actually keys, but you need the right 
component to retrieve it. Use the NOTEPAD if necessary, and then pick 
up the FIRST AID KIT and SHOTGUN SHELLS. As you leave, some nurses will 
be in this corridor. Use the HAMMER to deal with them, and then find 
the last door on the right. You'll now be at a stairwell. Follow this 
down to end up in a Classroom, with a solitary desk in the middle. Read 
the words etched on the wood.

'Go Home, Thief. Drop Dead.'

Since there's nothing else here, use the door at the end of this room.
In this next room is a hospital Gurney, with some PLIERS and a 
SCREWDRIVER sitting on top. Collect them and leave this room. Head back 
upstairs and enter the room to the right of the Elevator. In this 
bathroom, use the PLIERS on the tap to retrieve the KEY OF OPHIEL. Go 
back into the hall and find the OPHIEL DOOR, which is next to the 
stairwell that led to the classroom. Use the KEY to enter another 
hallway.

--------------
HALLWAY
--------------
In this Hall, find the only door that opens and get inside.
At the back of this room is the stone of time and surrounding it are 
three pictures with a keypad beneath them.

Under Sagittarius you the left, press 4. In Taurus at the center press 
6.And finally press 8 under Gemini on the right. This will release the 
STONE OF TIME. Pick it up, and then leave this room. You'll now want to 
head to the dead end of this hall to check out the Plate on the wall.

Names engraved on a Lithograph.
The Grim Reaper's list.
Yes, the headcount is set.
Young and old, lined up in order of age.
Then the pathway opens.
Awaiting them the frenzied uproar
The feast of death!

That means a lot, doesn't it? If you checked out a similar plate back 
at the Alternate Hospital, you'll know that there is a Grim Reaper's 
List somewhere around and surprise, surprise there's one pinned up on 
the wall near the locked door. Go up to it and read it for a better 
understanding of this puzzle.

35 Lydia Findly
60 Trevor F White
18 Albert Lords
45 Roberta T Morgan
38 Edward C Briggs

Now this puzzle starts to make a little sense.
"Lined Up in order of age". So I guess we should start by lining the 
names up in age order. This will open up the "Pathway". This is quite 
obviously the locked door.
Now we'll arrange them in name order.

18 Albert Lords
35 Lydia Findly
38 Edward C Briggs
45 Roberta T Morgan
60 Trevor F White

This reveals that the code is "ALERT". Enter this in the cool looking 
keypad to open up the door.

You'll now be confronted with a small storeroom. There's nothing in 
here of any significance, so head on through the door in the back to 
surface at a Morgue. At the far end, pinned up on the wall is an AMULET 
OF SOLOMON, which will come in handy near the end of the game. Attempt 
to leave this area back into the hallway and you'll be confronted with 
a rather sad scene that I'm not willing to spoil, accompanied with 
compassionate music.

After the scene is over, head back inside the storeroom and read the 
diary on the floor.

Ask doctor to let me quit being in charge of that patient.
It's too weird.
Still alive, but with wounds that won't heal.
Told the doctor I quit.
Won't work at that hospital anymore.
The room is filled with insects. 
Even with doors and windows shut they get in to spite me.
To the Hospital...
Feeling bad.
Need to throw up.
But nothing comes out.
Vomiting only bile.
Blood and pus flow from the bathroom faucet.
I try to stop it, but it won't turn off.
Need drug. 
Help me...
 
Then reenter the red ophiel door to enter the first hall. You'll want 
to get back to the ANTIQUE SHOP. Enter and use the stone of time on the 
Grandfather clock. The glass will explode, enabling the retrieval of 
the KEY OF HAGITH. Get back into the hall and use the key on the double 
doors at the end. You can now gain access to the elevator. Once inside, 
go to the SECOND FLOOR.

-----------------
THE SECOND FLOOR
-----------------
In this hall, only the third door on the left is open. This is the 
Jewelry shop again. In the display cases, take the CREST OF MERCURY and 
the RING OF CONTRACT and take the AMMO. Leave, reenter the hallway and 
use the door at the end to enter a new hall. Unlock the red double 
doors on the left hand side and then enter the first door on the right. 
Pick up the AMMO and the CAMERA. Now use the Red double doors to rejoin 
the first floor. Go back through the Hagith door and head up to the 
THIRD FLOOR. In this room will be an altar at the end, two locked doors 
on the side and two pictures beside the altar. Walk up to both pictures 
and use the Camera to reveal some shapes. Input these shapes on both 
Keypads on the two doors to unlock them.

Then enter the right door to read a page from a book:

WHITE CLAUDIA
Perennial herb found near water.
Reaches height of 10 to 15 inches.
Oblong leaves, white blossoms.
Seeds contain hallucinogen.
Ancient records show it was used for religious
Ceremonies.
The hallucinogenic effect was key.

Pick up the HANDGUN BULLETS and then enter the left hand door.
Inside will be a BIRDCAGE KEY and a HEALTHD DRINK. Pocket both and head 
to the first floor. Find the door we haven't opened yet, the one to the 
right of the first Elevator. Inside is a Birdcage. Use the BIRDCAGE KEY 
to obtain the KEY OF PHALEG, which opens the door just down the hall. 
This area now resembles the Hospital Basement area.

----------------
BASEMENT AREA 
----------------
Head on into the first door on the right. This is a Kitchen, and 
holding a chain together on the fridge is the DAGGER OF MELCHIOR, BUT 
BEFORE YOU LEAVE, Use the Ring of Contract on the door, as it will stop 
a monster from escaping. If this happens, it's game over. Leave the 
kitchen, deal with the nurses and enter the next-door down. In this 
storeroom, pick up the HEALTH DRINKS and AMMO, and notice the Bag of 
Jelly Beans in the back. Open it, and then pick up the KEY OF BETHOR 
from the debris. In the back of this room, is another door that 
contains a VCR. If you have videotape, you could use it. After all 
that, head back to the main hall and enter the second door on the left. 
After seeing a ghostly image, pick up the ANKH that's pinned to the 
wall. Reenter the hallway and use the BETHOR KEY on the Bethor door. 
Once inside, cut the power and head back into the Basement hall. Now go 
back through the PHALEG Door into the first hallway. Eliminate the near 
transparent Demon Children with the Handgun and enter the Red Double 
doors on the right hand side. You'll now be in the area where you last 
met Lisa. Kill yet more Demon Children and enter the last door on the 
right. At the back, you can finally use the Screwdriver to unscrew the 
metallic plate. Pick up the KEY OF ARATRON and retrace your steps back 
to the basement area, being wary of yet more children. In this hall, 
head to the last room on the right, again being careful of these 
babies.

=================
NOTE 
=================
In case your wondering, if you fail to use the Ring Of Contract on the 
door of the oversized fridge in the kitchen, then you'll have a very 
short cinema of Harry being dragged into the Fridge by a tentacle. What 
this tentacle is attached to is a mystery, but suffice to say, it will 
result in GAME OVER.

------------------
THE FINAL CHAPTER
------------------
In this room, you'll see the cult. Once this scene is over, you'll 
recognize this room as Alessa's Room. Pick up the Disk of Ouraboros and 
leave. Now enter the final room on the left. In this Child's room, use 
the DISK OF OUROBOROS, THE CREST OF MERCURY, THE ANKH, THE DAGGER OF 
MELCHIOR and the AMULET OF SOLOMAN to unlock the door. Then save your 
game at the Notepad. Head on through the door for a cutscene involving 
dahlia and Alessa.

In this balcony, head on down through the stairs for the final battle.

After the long scene is over (Don't Want to spoil what happens), you'll 
face the final boss, a Huge Winged Demon.

*********************
BOSS 5: HUGE DEMON
*********************
The HUNTING RIFLE is the only weapon to use here. If you were sensible 
you should have plenty of ammo. I'll be blunt here. There is only one 
real way of taking this dude down. Stand exactly where you are and 
constantly chug away at him with the rifle. If you fire continuously, 
you'll get off about 5-6 shots before he zaps you with a lightening 
bolt. When he does this, use a healing item (You should have enough). 
After about 20-25 shots he, and the game will be defeated.
Now watch the credits!

As the Demon is killed, Cheryl, or the girl made out of Cheryl and 
Alessa gives Harry a beautiful baby. Harry accepts this parting gift 
from the daughter he loves. Cybil wakes up from being knocked out from 
the blast. Kaufmann awakens but is tackled by Nurse Lisa Garland who 
drags him away to his fate. Both Cybil and Harry escape into the 
wilderness holding the baby. The girl is swept up by flames as Harry 
and Cybil finally escape.

Now sit back and watch the credits and see what score you got. Look in 
the background to see what items you obtained. Then read the secrets 
section.

===---===---===---===---=
I: SECRET ITEMS
===---===---===---===---=
There are a number of secret items available to you once you have 
completed the game. This is a list of the secret items available to you 
and how you obtain them.

---------------------
CHANNELING STONE
---------------------
The Channeling stone is a mysterious emerald inside a stone, that 
appears inside the Convenience store on Bachman road, near Harry's 
jeep. You can only get this in NEXT FEAR mode. After completing the 
game, choose yes to save the progress. The save will now be in gold and 
will be called Next Fear. On the game completion screen, the items you 
have unlocked will be seen in the background. If you see a blue jewel 
with a yellow outline, congratulations, you have got the Channeling 
stone. The appearance of the Channeling stone is unclear. When Writing 
this Guide, I got the Good+ ending on purpose, and obtained the stone, 
so if you follow my guide and get the Good+ ending, you shall have the 
channeling stone. The Channeling stone is the required device that can 
help you get the hilarious UFO ending.
To get this ending, you must use the Channeling stone at some 
particular stages in the game:
1: Roof of the alternate school.
2: Courtyard of alternate hospital, just before Giant moth fight.
3: Norman's Motel, In front of the apartments.
4: In the Houseboat.
6: Roof of the Lighthouse.

--------------------
KATANA
--------------------
The Katana is a silver Japanese Samurai Warrior sword, the same one 
Gray Fox uses in Metal Gear Solid. It's a fairly cool weapon, one of 
the best Melee weapons out there. Its appearance is up for debate as 
usual. Some believe it appears randomly after completing the game with 
different endings. I get it when getting the Bad+ ending. Try getting 
the Bad+ ending and see if you get it. Once you have unlocked the 
Katana, you will see it in the background of the stats screen once you 
complete the game. It is found in the Japanese room of the Levin Street 
doghouse.

---------------
CHAINSAW
---------------
At the end of Bloch Street, not the one with the drawbridge, on the 
right hand side is a building called Cut Write Chainsaws. The window is 
smashed, and on the display window is a Chainsaw. Problem is there is 
no fuel. Get it from the garage and go here. You can now use the 
Chainsaw but not the Rock Drill. It really is a cool weapon, taking out 
the apes in a few swings and the same with the nurses and doctors at 
the hospital.

----------------
ROCK DRILL
----------------
A lot like the Chainsaw, this weapon can only be obtained after getting 
the Gas canister from the garage and going up to the lower room of the 
drawbridge control room. It's not as good as the Saw, but is still a 
useful weapon.

--------------
GAS CAN
--------------
You will usually get this the first time you play the game. Pick it up 
at the garage on Bloch Street, and use it with either the Drill or 
Chainsaw.

-------------
HYPERBLASTER
-------------
The Hyperblaster is a version of Konami's old Lightgun. There are two 
ways of getting this weapon. 1, Get the Secret UFO ending. It will 
appear at the clear stats screen and at the start of the game in the 
Cafe. 2 Get the ACTUAL lightgun and plug in to Controller port two. 
It's cumbersome as it requires two people to work it, but it works!
Of course the Hyperblaster is an awesome weapon, but after completing 
the game over and over, you can gain access to more powerful versions 
of the Blaster with different colored beams.

---------------
CHEATING
---------------
Before you confront Dahlia at the basement, use up all the ammo from 
your guns. The boss will be *Easy* to beat. He He.
Also, note that this cannot be done with the Hyperblaster in your 
inventory.

------------
INTRO
------------
After completing the game with the Good+ rating, the intro will change 
from Harry's wife to Cybil.


===---===---===---===---=
II: ENDINGS
===---===---===---===---=
As you may already know, there is more than one ending to Silent Hill. 
I wrote this guide so that you would obtain the best possible ending, 
the Good + one, but you need to do certain things in order to get the 
others.

==============
ENDINGS
==============
GOOD+
GOOD
BAD+
BAD
UFO

---------------
THE FLAGPOINTS
---------------
Flag point one: Kaufmann.
You need to save Kaufmann at the bar, visit the Indian runner and use 
the Motorcycle key. You will now get the Good ending. If you don't you 
can only get a Bad ending. 

Flag Point Two: If you don't use the liquid on Cybil at the amusement 
park, and simply kill her, you will not get a + ending. You can only 
get a good or bad ending. Got It?

Lets hope this will explain better:

I saved Kaufmann but didn't go to the Motel and use the motorcycle key. 
I also killed Cybil. What ending will I get?
You've got the bad ending.

I Saved Kaufmann and used the motorcycle key but killed Cybil. What 
ending will I get?
The Good ending.

I saved Cybil but forgot about Kaufmann, what ending will I get?
The Bad+ ending.

I saved Cybil and did all the Kaufmann things, what ending will I get?
The Good+ ending.

How do I get the UFO ending?
The Channeling stone is the required device that can help you get the 
hilarious UFO ending.
To get this ending, you must use the Channeling stone at some 
particular stages in the game:
1: Roof of the alternate school.
2: Courtyard of alternate hospital, just before Giant moth fight.
3: Norman's Motel, In front of the apartments.
4: In the Houseboat.
6: Roof of the Lighthouse.

To get the channeling stone, you must get a Good ending. You should 
pick it up at the Convenience store on Bachman road in Next Fear mode. 
After you use it at the Lighthouse, the game will end. You can now use 
the Hyperblaster with this new save. Enjoy!

Kaufmann shoots Dahlia, and throws the vial of Aphlagotis on the child. 
A Huge demon comes out of her back. Harry defeats the Demon. As fire 
guts the entire area, Cheryl/Alessa gives Harry a newborn baby. She 
shows him an escape route. As Harry runs towards the light, Cybil 
awakens and follows him. As Kaufmann tries to follow, he's stopped in 
his tracks by the demonic Lisa Garland who pulls him underneath the 
grating. Cheryl/Alessa is then swept up by flames.

Instead of the flying demon, Harry dukes it out with Cheryl/Alessa. 
After killing her, Harry faces up to the nightmare truth. As Harry

UFO

After using the Channeling stone for the final time on the roof of the 
lighthouse, the lights that have been shadowing Harry finally reveal 
themselves as UFO's. They beam down and several Grays come out. Harry 
rather stupidly asks them if they've seen Cheryl (Funny!), and the 
aliens then zap him.

III: CINEMATIC TRANSCRIPTS
===---===---===---===---===
This is a transcript of all the conversations in the game. Obviously, 
I've left out the smaller ones in favor of the ones that matter in 
relation to the plot. Enjoy!

-------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC ONE:
LOCATION: CAFE
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON AND CYBIL BENNETT.
-------------------------------------------
[Harry Mason suddenly wakes up on a Cafe table. Looking around, he sees 
a uniformed Police officer walking towards him].

Harry: Was I dreaming?
Cybil: How do you feel?
Harry: Like I've been run over by a truck. But I'm all right I guess.
Cybil: Glad to hear it. You from around here? Why don't you tell me 
what happened.
Harry: Wait a second; I'm just a tourist. I came here on vacation. I 
just got here. I don't know what happened. I'd like to find out for 
myself.
Have you seen a little girl? Just turned seven last month-Short black 
hair. My daughter.
Cybil: Sorry. The only person I've seen in this town is you.
Harry: Where is everybody?
Cybil: I'd tell you if I knew, believe me. But from what I can tell, 
something bizarre is going on. That's all I know.
Harry: Hmmm.
Cybil: What's your name?
Harry: Harry. Harry Mason.
Cybil: Cybil Bennett. I'm a police officer from Brahms, the next town 
over. The Phone's out and the radio too. I'm going back to call in some 
reinforcements.
Harry: Hmpf.
[Harry gets up and walks towards the door].
Cybil: Hold it!
[Harry stops]
Cybil: Where do you think your going?
Harry: My daughter, I've got to find her!
Cybil: No way, It's dangerous out there.
Harry: In that case I need to find her now; Cheryl's my little girl. I 
can't just leave her out there by herself.
Cybil: Have you got a gun?
Harry: Err, No.
[Cybil pulls out a Handgun and hands it to Harry]
Cybil: Take this, and hope you don't have to use it. Now listen to me. 
Before you pull the trigger, know who your shooting. And don't do it 
unless you have to. And don't go blasting me by mistake. Got It?
Harry: Yeah, Thanks.
[Harry puts the gun in his pocket]
Cybil: You'll do best to stay nearby. I'll be back as quick as I can.
[Cybil then leaves the cafe].

-----------------------------------------
CINEMATIC TWO
LOCATION: BALKAN CHURCH
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, DAHLIA GILLESPIE
-----------------------------------------
[Harry enters the church. A woman at the front turns around]

Harry: Were you ringing that bell?
Dahlia: I've been expecting you. It was foretold by Gyromancy.
Harry: What are you talking about?
Dahlia: I knew you'd come. You want the girl, right?
Harry: the Girl? You're talking about Cheryl!!?
Dahlia: I see everything.
Harry: You know something? Tell me!
Dahlia: Stay Back! Nothing is to be gained from floundering about at 
random. You must follow the path. The path of the hermit concealed by 
Flauros!
Harry: What? What are you talking about?
Dahlia: Here! The Flauros. A cage of peace. It can break through the 
walls of darkness and counteract the wrath of the Underworld. These 
will help you. Make haste to the Hospital before it is too late.
[Dahlia Leaves]
Harry: Wait! Don't go yet!

-----------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC THREE
LOCATION: EXAMINATION ROOM, HOSPITAL
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, DR. MICHAEL KAUFMANN
-----------------------------------------------
[Harry enters the Examination room. A man with blood shot eyes sits on 
a bed, a Revolver in his hand. Lying on the floor is a dead winged 
demon. The man gets up to confront Harry.]
Harry: Hold it? Stop don't shoot!
[Kaufmann fires, missing Harry.]
Harry: Wait, I'm not here to fight, my name is Harry Mason, I'm in town 
on vacation.
[Kaufmann Relaxes]
Kaufmann: Thank god. Another human being.
Harry: Do you work here?
Kaufmann: I'm Dr. Michael Kaufmann. I work at this hospital.
Harry: So maybe you can tell me what's going on.
Kaufmann: I really can't say. I was taking a nap in the staff room. 
When I woke up it was like this. Everyone seems to have disappeared. 
And it's snowing out. This time of year. Something's gone seriously 
wrong. Did you see those monsters? Have you ever seen such aberrations? 
Ever even heard of such things? You and I both know creatures like that 
don't exist.
Harry: Yeah. Have you seen a little girl anywhere? I'm looking for my 
daughter. She's only seven, short black hair.
Kaufmann: She's missing? I'm sorry. But with all those monsters around, 
I highly doubt she's-
[Harry sighs]
Kaufmann: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to alarm you. Your wife, she's here 
with you?
Harry: She died, 4 year ago. Now it's just me and my daughter.
Kaufmann: I see. I'm sorry. 
[Kaufmann picks up a briefcase and heads for the door.]
Kaufmann: Well, I better be going. Ican't just sit around doing 
nothing.
Harry: So long, good luck out there.
[Kaufmann leaves]

------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC FIVE
LOCATION: ALTERNATE EXAMINATION ROOM
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, LISA GARLAND
------------------------------------------
[Harry enters the Examination room with his newfound key. His Torch 
beam scans the room. Suddenly, a young woman springs out from 
underneath the table and holds Harry. She is obviously VERY relieved.]

Lisa: Finally, someone else whose Ok.
Harry: Who are you?
Lisa: My names Lisa Garland, what's yours?
Harry: Harry Mason.
Lisa: Harry, tell mewhat's happening here, where is everybody? I must 
have gotten knocked out. When I came to, everyone was gone. It's awful.
Harry: So you don't know anything either. Great. I just don't get it. 
It's like this is all some kind of bad dream.
Lisa: Yeah, a living nightmare.
Harry: Let me ask you. Have you seen a little girl around here? Short 
black hair, seven years old?
Lisa: A seven-year-old girl? What, she's your daughter?
Harry: Yes.
Lisa: A seven-year-old girl.
I can't say that I have. I was unconscious all this time. I'm sorry.
Harry: That's all right. Do you know anything about all that weird 
stuff in the basement?
Lisa: No. Why is there something down there? 
Harry: You don't know? Don't you work here?
Lisa: Were under strict orders never to enter the basement storeroom, 
so I really don't know. What did you say was down there?
Harry: Well, It's-
[Harry hears the very same sirens he has heard throughout. He grabs his 
head in agony.]
Lisa: What's wrong? Harry....? Harry! Let me help you Harry......

-----------------------------------------
CINEMTATIC SIX
LOCATION: EXAMINATION ROOM
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON DAHLIA GILLESPIE
-----------------------------------------
[For some reason, Harry has materialized in the examination room of the 
proper hospital.]
Harry: Was I dreaming?
[Dahlia Gillespie enters the room].
Dahlia: You were too late.
Harry: It's you!
Dahlia: Yes. Dahlia Gillespie.
Harry: Tell me everything you know. What's going on?
Dahlia: Darkness. The town is being devoured by darkness. Strength must 
overcome petty desire, childish sleep talk! I knew this day would come.
Harry: What are you talking about? I don't understand a word of this!
Dahlia: Believe the evidence of your eyes! The other church in this 
town that is your destination. This is beyond my abilities. Only you 
can stop it now. Have you not seen the crest marked on the ground all 
over town?
Harry: So that's what I saw in the schoolyard. What does it mean?
Dahlia: It is the mark of Samael. Do not let it be completed!
[And with that, Dahlia leaves.]
Harry: hey wait, Stop!

---------------------------------------
CINEMATIC SEVEN
LOCATION: GREEN LION ANTIQUE SHOP
CHARACTERS: CYBIL BENNETT, HARRY MASON
---------------------------------------
[Harry slides back the shelf, revealing an alcove. Cybil enters the 
room.]
Harry: What's this.
Cybil: Harry!
Harry: Cybil!
Cybil: I'm glad your OK. I shouldn't have left you. Things are worse 
than I thought. Its nuts.
Harry: What are you doing here, I thought you left town!
Cybil: I saw you go in here, so I followed you. I couldn't get out. All 
the roads out of town are blocked. Cars have completely stopped 
running. And the phones and radios are still out too.
Harry: What about my daughter, did you see her!
Cybil: I did see a girl.
Harry: Was it Cheryl!?
Cybil: I only caught a glimpse of her through the fog. I went after 
her, but she vanished. I don't know about you daughter, but....
Harry: And you just let her go!!! Where was it!
Cybil: On Bachman road, she was heading towards the lake. Now don't get 
excited. It wasn't like she ran off exactly. There was no place for her 
to go. The road has been obliterated.
Harry: What, so then Cheryl...
Cybil: It was like she was walking on thin air..........What about you?
Harry: Yeah, I met this bizarre woman. Her name is Dahlia Gillespie. Do 
you know her?
Cybil: Dahlia Gillespie? No. And?
Harry: She said something about the town being devoured by darkness. 
Gibberish like that. Any idea what it means?
Cybil: Darkness devouring the town? Must be on drugs. They sell em to 
the tourists. The force still can't figure out whose behind it. No 
leads have panned out, and the investigation is stalled.
Harry: What could drug trafficking have to do with all this?
Cybil: Hmmm. I really don't know. But maybe that's the darkness she was 
talking about. That's all I can think of.
Harry: Hmmm.
[Cybil notices the alcove.]
Cybil: What's this?
Harry: Just discovered it. Maybe there's something back there.
Cybil: Lets have a look.
Harry: Wait! We don't know what's back there. I better check it out 
first.
Cybil: I'm a cop, I should go.
Harry: No! I'm going!
Cybil: All right. I'll cover you from here. But if anything looks 
fishy, get back here on the double.
Harry: Oh.......Cybil?
Cybil: Yes?
Harry: Do you know anything about, well, some other world? It's like a 
bad dream.
Cybil: What are you talking about?
Harry: I'm not quite sure. I try to make sense o it, but my mind goes 
blank. Everything's dark there, and I hear sirens in the distance. I 
met this nurse, Lisa. It's like I was there, but not really, its all a 
blur, like some kind of Hallucination, you know?
Cybil: I have no idea what your talking about Harry.
Harry: Oh, I was just wondering, never mind.
Cybil: Harry, Your tired.
Harry: Yeah Maybe.
[Harry walks through. He finds some sort of altar.]
Harry: What's this? I've never seen anything like this before. Maybe 
this is the other church.
[As Harry leaves, the candle on the altar starts burning.]
Harry: Huh! What the..........
[Cybil investigates. She goes into the altar room. Harry has vanished.]
Cybil: Harry? Are you OK? Harry...................Harry.

-------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC EIGHT
LOCATION: EXAMINATION ROOM
CHARACTERS: LISA GARLAND AND HARRY MASON
-------------------------------------------
Harry: Where am I?
Lisa: Harry!
Harry: Lisa? Then I'm in the hospital?
Lisa: You were having a bad dream.
Harry: I was? Hey, you don't look too good, are you OK?
Lisa: I'm fine. Nothing you need to worry about.
Harry: Lisa, do you know a woman named Dahlia Gillespie?
Lisa: Oh yeah, that crazy Gillespie lady. She's kind of famous around 
here. She never sees anybody, so I really don't know that much about 
her. But I heard her kid died in a fire and supposedly, she's been 
crazy ever since.
Harry: Well, she says the town is being devoured by the darkness. Do 
you have any idea what she's talking about?
Lisa: The town being devoured by the darkness? Yes, I think I do. 
Before this place was turned into a resort, the townspeople were on the 
quiet side. Everybody followed some kind of queer religion. Weird 
occult stuff. Black magic, that kind of thing.
As young people moved away, people said they were summoned by the gods.
Evidently, things like that used to happen around here all the time. 
Before the resort there really wasn't anything out here.
Everyone was so flipped out...........Got to blame it on something. 
Then a lot of new people came in and everybody clammed up about it.
Harry: A cult.
Lisa: Last time I hear anything about it was gosh, years ago. When 
several people connected with developing the town died in accidents. 
People said it was a curse. Oh, I'm, sorry, I'm rambling. I'll shut up.
[Harry then wakes up in the middle of the antique shop. The floor is 
now a metallic grating, similar to that at the alternate hospital and 
school.]
Harry: Was that another dream? Did I pass out again?

---------------------------------------
CINEMATIC NINE
LOCATION: EXAMINATION ROOM! 
CHARACTERS: LISA GARLAND, HARRY MASON
---------------------------------------
Lisa: Harry!
Harry: Glad your Ok.
Lisa: Thank god you came back. I was scared to be here all alone.
Harry: I'm here now. I was worried too. I'm real happy to see you.
Lisa, Can you tell me how to get to the lake?
Lisa: the Lake? You take Bachman road.
Harry: The roads blocked.
Lisa: Well that's the only road out there.
Harry: Are you sure? There's got to be another way.
Lisa: Wait! I just remembered something!
Harry: What?
Lisa: There's a Waterworks over by my old elementary school. It's been 
abandoned or years. There's an underground tunnel used for inspections 
or something. I remember hearing it runs all the way to the lake.
Harry: Really? Do you think I can get to the lake from there?
Lisa: I've never been down there myself, so I'm not positive. Besides, 
it's all fenced off to keep people out.
Harry: If there's a chance, I've got to try.
Lisa: Harry! Don't go! I don't want to be alone. It's so scary I can't 
stand it!
Harry: How about coming with me? This may not be the safest place in 
the world either. I can't promise anything, but I'll do my best to 
protect you.
Lisa: No. Somehow I feel like I'm not supposed to leave this place. Oh 
Harry, I'm so scared I'm Cold!
Harry: Look, just wait here a little longer. I'll be back as soon as I 
find my daughter.
Lisa: Harry.....

CINEMATIC NINE
LOCATION: ANNIE'S BAR 
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, DR. MICHAEL KAUFMANN
-----------------------------------------------
[As Harry enters Annie's bar, he sees Dr.Kaufmann on the floor being 
attacked by a Teddy. Harry takes careful aim and dispatches it. 
Kaufmann gets up, but not before kicking the limp body of his 
attacker.]

Harry: Are You Okay?
Kaufmann: Yeah, I guess so. But I'm beat. I thought I was a goner 
there. So how'd it go, did you find a way out?
Harry: No. Not yet. How about you?
Kaufmann: Zip. But It's too soon to give up. This Craziness can't go on 
forever. A military rescue squad should be here anytime now. If they 
come through the town, were home free.
Harry: I hope so.
Kaufmann: I better get going. This isn't the time to stand around 
flapping our gums.
[Kaufmann heads for the door.]
Harry: Do you know a girl named Alessa?
Kaufmann: No.

-------------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC TEN
LOCATION: GARAGE, NORMAN'S MOTEL
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, DR. MICHAEL KAUFMANN
-------------------------------------------------
[Harry has just discovered a vial of liquid, similar to the one he 
found in the Hospital. Kaufmann enters. He looks real pissed off.]

Kaufmann: Give me that!
Harry: What is this?
[Kaufmann snatches it away from Harry.]
Kaufmann: That's none of your business. Instead of messing with thatm 
how about coming up with a way to0 get out of here. You shouldn't be 
hanging around here goofing off. What do you think your doing? You want 
to get yourself killed, get out of here!
Harry: Okay, Take it easy!
Kaufmann: Unless you want to die, keep your mind on business, Got It?
[Kaufmann then leaves.]

-----------------------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC ELEVEN
LOCATION: THE HOUSBOAT
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, CYBIL BENNETT, AND DAHLIA GILLESPIE.
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Cybil enters the Houseboat.]

Cybil: Harry!
Harry: Cybil? How did you get here!
Cybil: I followed the sewer. Were you the one who cut the fence?
Harry: Yeah. I'm glad you made it. I was worried about you.
Cybil: You were worried? Where did you disappear to! Never mind. I want 
to know what's going on. What's with this town?
Harry: This may sound really off the wall, but listen to me. You've got 
to believe me. I've not gone crazy, and I'm not fooling around. At 
first I thought I was losing my mind. But now I know I'm not. It's not 
me. This whole town. It's being invaded by the other world. Worlds of 
someone's nightmarish delusions come to life. Little by little the 
invasion is spreading. Trying to swallow up everything in darkness. I 
think I'm finally beginning to understand what that lady was talking 
about.
Cybil: Harry. Hold on a minute. I don't get it.
Harry: Look, I don't understand it all myself. I guess I can't explain 
it.
Cybil: Well what's making this happen?
Harry: I don't know that either. But I know Cheryl is "There".
Cybil: "There"?
Harry: Under whoever created this darkness. Cheryl is somewhere and she 
needs my help.
Cybil: Harry, this whole thing has been a major blow to you. You need 
to rest.
Harry: Cybil, I
[Harry's interrupted by the entrance of Dahlia Gillespie.]
Dahlia: The demon is awakening, spreading those wings!
Harry: Dahlia Gillespie.
Dahlia: Was it not as I said? I see it all now-Yes everything. And with 
the sacrifice, the demon will swallow up the land. I knew this day 
would come. And the task is almost finished. There are only two left. 
To seal this town to the abyss, the mark of Samael. When it's 
completed, all is lost. Even in daytime, darkness will cover the sun. 
The dead will walk and martyrs will burn in the fires of hell. Everyone 
will die!
Harry: So what am I supposed to do; I've got to find Cheryl!
Dahlia: Stop the demon! The demon that is taking that child's form! You 
must stop it before your daughter becomes a sacrifice. Before it is too 
late! Stop it! STOP IT!
Harry: What do I do?
Dahlia: Go to the lighthouse on the lake. And to the center of the 
amusement park. You are the only hope.
Cybil: Look Harry, I really don't know what's going on, but if there's 
a chance we can save your daughter, I'm in. I'll check out the 
amusement park. You go to the lighthouse.
Harry: Cybil...Thanks.
[Cybil leaves.]
Dahlia: You will need to use it.
Harry: Use what?
Dahlia: The Flauros! Only with that can you stop it.
Harry: What about Cybil?
[Dahlia leaves.]

----------------------------------------------
CINEMATIC TWELVE
LOCATION: CAROUSEL
CHARACTERS: HARRY MASON, CYBIL BENNETT
----------------------------------------------
[Harry uses the mysterious liquid on Cybil.]

Cybil: Uh. Uhooh. Ureagghahahah!
[A creature escapes from Cybil's back. Harry stamps on it.]
Harry: Cybil, wake up! Snap out of it. Cybil.
Cybil: Harry, what happened?
Harry: Shush, Don't talk; I'll take care of you.
[Scene switches]
Cybil: Harry? Why did they take your daughter? Why her?
Harry: I don't know myself, but you know, Cheryl isn't my biological 
daughter. I actually haven't told her yet. She probably knows anyway 
though. We found her abandoned by the side of the highway. Nobody knew 
where she came from, and we didn't have any kids of our own. And my 
wife was sick and it didn't look like she was getting any better. So we 
took Cheryl in.
Cybil: So in that case...
Harry: There might be some connection between Cheryl and this town.
Cybil: So what do you do now?
Harry: Cheryl is my daughter. I'll save her no matter what.

all I ask.
[Alessa raises her arm. A beam knocks Harry backwards.]
Harry: What?
[Harry runs at Alessa but a force field bars his approach.]
Harry: Damm!
[Dahlia enters.]
Harry: What is this?
[The Flauros levitates out of Harry's pocket. A blue light shoots out 
of it, hitting Alessa.]
Alessa: AHHHHHHH!
Harry: Where's Cheryl, Give me back my daughter!
Dahlia: We meet at last Alessa!
Alessa: !! 
Harry: Dahlia Gillespie. Where's Cheryl, Where is she!
Dahlia: Alessa, this is the end of your little game.
Alessa: Mama!
Harry: Could she mean?
Dahlia: You've been a ghastly little pest, haven't you Alessa?
I was careless thinking you couldn't escape from our spell. But mommy 
didn't realize how much you'd grown. That's why I couldn't catch you by 
myself. And what a pity, Yes? Now your half Indebted to this MAN for 
his help.
Harry: Hey, what are you talking about!

Lisa: Harry, listen, something you said before has been bothering me. I 
just can't get it out of my head.
Harry: What is it Lisa?
Lisa: So I went to look in the basement. Even though I was as scared as 
hell. Like you said there were these creepy rooms, but nothing really 
unusual down there. But while I was down there, I got this weird 
feeling. Like I've been there before. Like something happened there but 
I can't quite remember it. What was it?
Harry! Help me; I'm so scared I can't take this.
Harry: It's only a temporary thing. You're in shock from when you were 
knocked out. Don't fret about it, you'll remember in a while.

[Lisa runs for the door and leaves.]

dead. I'm not the only one who's still walking around. I'm the same as 
them! I just hadn't noticed it before.
Harry: Lisa.
Lisa: Stay by me Harry please! I'm so scared! Help me!
Save me from them Harry. Please. Harry
[Harry backs towards the door and shoos Lisa away. Lisa breaks down 
crying. Lisa, now resigned to her tragic fate begins to bleed from the

Hispanic man: But it's not done yet. Half the soul is lost.
That is why the seed lies dormant.
Man In Lab Coat: And What soul remains captured in that Husk. Is buried 
deep down in the subconscious.
Kaufmann: Are you trying to say it wont work? That wasn't our 
agreement!
Dahlia: No, No these are just stalling tactics. If we lend a hand we 
will be able to get power. Never fear the promise shall not be broken.
Hispanic Man: But the power we can draw now will be very weak. Almost 
nothing. Unless we get the other half of the soul.
Dahlia: We'll use a magical spell. Sealing the child's pain is sure to 
come.
Man In Lab Coat: But that will take time.

bit of your power, that's all.
Alessa: No! I don't want to do it.
Dahlia: It would make everyone happy, and it's for your own good.
Alessa: No, but mommy I just want to be with you. Just the two of us, 
please understand.
Dahlia: I see. Maybe mommy has been wrong.
Alessa: Mommy?
Dahlia: Why didn't I see this before? There's no reason to wait. Herein 
lies the mother's womb, containing the power to create life. I could 
have done it all myself!
Alessa: Mommy?

CINEMATIC EIGHTEEN, THE FINAL CHAPTER
LOCACTION: FINAL ARENA 
CHARACTERS: EVERYONE!
-----------------------------------------------
[Dahlia, Alessa and a figure in a wheelchair stand in the center of the 
room. Cybil loads her Handgun and aims it at Dahlia.]

Dahlia: I was shocked to learn that the Talisman of Metratron was being 
used/ In spite of the lost soul returning at last, If we waited any 
longer, all would have been for naught. It's all because of that man. 
We must be thankful to him. Even though Alessa has been stopped, his 
little girl has to go, what a pity Ahahahahahahaha!!!
Cybil: Freeze!
[Cybil fires, but another force field prevents the bullet from passing 
through.]
Cybil: What in the devils name?
[A blast knocks Cybil flying. She's knocked out. Harry now enters the 
room and confronts Dahlia.]
Harry: Dahlia!
Dahlia: Well, Well, Well to think you'd make it this far.
Harry: Where's Cheryl, what have you done to her?
Dahlia: What are you talking about? You've seen her many times, 
restored to her former self.
Harry: I'm in no mood for jokes.
Dahlia: Don't you see! She's right there!
[Points to Alessa.]
Harry: That's absurd!
Dahlia: You are the only one who thinks so.
Harry: Why? Why are you doing this?
Dahlia: It's been a long seven years. For the seven years since that 
terrible day. Alessa has been kept alive suffering a fate worse than 
death. Alessa has been trapped in an endless nightmare from which she 
never awakens. She has been nurtured by that nightmare. Waiting for the 
day to be born. That day has finally come. The time is neigh. Everyone 
will be relieved from pain and suffering. Our salvation is at hand. 
This is the day of reckoning. When all our sorrows will be washed away. 
When we return to the true paradise! My daughter will be the mother of 
God!
[The figure in the wheelchair rises and transforms into an Angelic 
girl. A gunshot rings out and Dahlia falls over. Kaufmann enters.]
Kaufmann: Quit screwing around! Return things to how they were before!
Harry: Kaufmann!
Kaufmann: Did I ask for this? Nobody uses me! You wont get away with 
this...
Dahlia: Your role is over we don't need you anymore. What did you think 
you could accomplish by coming here?
Kaufmann: My, Aren't we getting cocky! Bet you can't see this and keep 
your cool! 
[Kaufmann pulls out the vial that Harry found at the Motel.]
Dahlia: Aglaphotis!!! I thought I got rid of that!
Kaufmann: All I had to do was plant it somewhere for you to find; You 
all, Well, It kept you busy. Ha you're easy! And there's more where 
this came from!
Dahlia: Stop It!
[Kaufmann throws the Vial. It hits the angel. A huge demon comes out of 
her back!]
Harry: Huh? What the!
Kaufmann: What on earth? That's not supposed to!
Dahlia: AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHHAHAHA!!!!
[The demon flies in the air. It lets out an energy blast that sets 
Dahlia on fire. Dahlia is killed, and the battle is set.]]

CHAPTER IV: FAQ
===---===---===---===---=
Q: I missed the Rifle back at the Sandpit/Boss area. Can I go back and 
get it?
A: If you missed it, you can only go back and get it if you have not 
started the giant moth fight yet. If you go any further than this, kiss 
that lovely Rifle goodbye.

Q: Can I drive a car? What about the Houseboat?
A: You cannot drive any car or the boat in this game. There is a rowing 
boat in Silent Hill 2, however.

Q: Can I take the drugs?
A: No!

Q: My friend says that if you press "Blah Blah Blah" at the title 
screen, you get infinite ammo...
A: Wrong, there are no codes that give cheats in this game. Your friend 
is a liar. Go round to his house and force him to admit he's wrong. 
Then cave his head in. Or maybe not.

Q: Are there any secret weapons? I want an Uzi!!!
A: There are 4 secret weapons: Hyperblaster, Katana, Rock Drill and the 
Chainsaw.

Q: Is the Katana at the Dog House or in the K. Gordon house? 
A: The Dog House, where you use the Keys of "Woodman", "Scarecrow" and 
"Lion".

Q: Can those Babies at the school/Amusement Park harm me?
A: Apart from a high-pitched yelp, the Babies are harmless. They do 
appear towards the end of the game, and can hurt you. They're hard to 
see as well so don't get complacent when you see them.

Q: Can I save Lisa?
A: Sadly, Lisa cannot be saved from her tragic fate. She does appear in 
the ending if you do all the Kaufmann things at the Motel/Indian 
Runner.

CHAPTER II: E-MAIL POLICY AND CONTRIBUTIONS
===---===---===---======---===---===---===---====
Silent Hill is such a huge town/Game that it may be impossible to 
document every little Easter egg in the game in one guide and it's 
highly likely that I've overlooked something, made an error or have 
messed up at some point. Therefore it's your informal duty as readers 
of this guide to contact me in order to report mistakes and/Or make 
contributions in order to make this guide a better place. If you have 
something to contribute, whether it is a code, secret, short 
walkthrough or boss tactic/Strategy, please contact me and I'll most 
likely include it in a future update. I will make no claim to any 
contributions as my own; I'll make it crystal clear that someone else 
has written it. If you contact me, be sure to leave your Name and/Or 
GameFAQs username, whichever you prefer. If you don't I'll have to use 
your E-Mail address. And of course you'll get full credit for it. My 
Address is mrwhite@btopenworld.com. Please, I implore you to make it 
known to me what's up so I can amend it swiftly. Before contacting me, 
please read the E-Mail policy, below.

I will keep adding to this guide indefinitely, but there will of course 
be a time when I'll have to bring it to a conclusion, and at that point 
I will have to accept no more contributions, so please, when the guide 
is complete, so not bombard me with E-Mails as they will most likely be 
ignored. I will trust you guys and gals not to abuse this service, but 
I'll make it plain that I do not want people to send me junk mail, 
Pornographic links and Spam in general. This is one thing that I will 
not tolerate; so don't force me to shut it down. Thanks for reading.
