  To start, I'd like to mention that this game surpassed my expectations by
far. After being very unsatisfied with Silent Hill: Origins, I had very low 
expectations for this game, knowing that it was under development by the 
same people, Climax. I've been a fan of the series since the first and own 
all the games, movie, as well as soundtracks. 

  When Team Silent was no longer going to be continuing the series, I became
skeptical about the series' future. Silent Hill: Origins was rather 
disastrous. Silent Hill: Homecoming was alright, but ultimately felt like it
had too many things thrown in just to classify the game as Silent Hill (IE: 
Pyramid Head, otherworld transition, nurses) and not enough to stand on its 
own.

  Nevertheless, Climax has redeemed themselves both for Silent Hill: Origins
as well as the series' future. It will stand as an idol amongst the 
psychological horror genre of video games and has restored the reputation of
the series.

"Fighting" - Nightmare Tips

  Throughout the game there is no combat. During nightmare sequences, you 
will be pursued by monsters, but you can't fight them. When they grab onto
you, you have to throw the Wiimote and nunchuk in the manner displayed. 
Generally, you can get away with just violently shaking the wiimote, but
this doesn't always work as effectively as you would like.

  Commonly throughout nightmare sequences, there will be lights to generally
guide you where to go. Outside, they're in the distance. Indoors, there is
sometimes a light or lamp above the door to the correct path.

  During nightmare sequences, you'll also come across movable objects. These
objects can be cast down to delay pursuing enemies. To do this, swing the
nunchuk as you approach the object. You'll know if you can knock it down if
the swing animation is shown as you approach it. It will also have a faint
arrow above it.

  Hiding is never useful. Perhaps it's my own experience, but I have never
found a use for hiding throughout the game. The monsters will just wander
around for a bit before they find you anyway; they will never leave
permanently.

  Turning your flashlight off can help sometimes. In each nightmare 
sequence you can skip the first few enemies by simply turning off your 
flashlight. The doors and ledges you need to go to are lit up anyway, so 
it's not crucial to have the light on.

Personality Inventory (PI)

  Throughout this document, you'll notice several references to PI. PI, an
acronym for Personality Inventory, is what controls various aspects of
the game. Conversations, attitudes, outfits, and the ending are all impacted
by your PI. There are five main types of PI throughout the game, they are:

 - Sexual - The most common; primarily influences appearances
 - Friendliness - Primarily influences interactions with people
 - Family - Primarily affects the ending cutscenes
 - Alcoholic - Primarily influences Dahlia and the ending cutscenes
 - Fake - Only influences the ending

  Each of these are fairly obvious, except for the fake PI. The fake PI only
impacts the ending cutscenes and suggests that you aren't interested in the
doctor's therapy. Basically, to build this PI, take every opportunity to
appear as though you aren't answering the questions truthfully. (See the
endings for more info).

  Each type of PI is evaluated when you come to a part of the game that includes
something that changes according to your current PI. Whichever PI you have been
building the most of will take precedence.

  However, it is rare that a single object with PI will change anything. What I
mean is: you can't expect something to change based on a single event. The
whole idea is to evaluate your trends and create a psychological profile. This
is collected by a multitude of actions/responses. That said, there are some
events that are much more influential than others.

o+- Therapy - The Test -+o

  This form is the initial psycho-profiling that happens in this game. The 
profiling influences various aspects of the game. Some affect the ending, 
while others only influence a scene or two.

  Even if you're hunting for a specific ending, they all take
influences from multiple events; don't worry about getting everytying that
contributes to a specific ending.

  Particularly for first-time players, don't worry about repercussions of
your choices, they're all minor. Just choose whatever you like.


Question			Primary Influence

1. I make friends easily	Friendliness PI; Access to Bar

2. Having a drink helps me	Alcoholic PI; Good Old Days Bar

III.1 Junkyard 

  There's a binder on the ground here. It must be inspected if you intend to
enter the Good Old Days bar. Don't step on it or inspect the bear. If you do,
Harry won't comment on the binder and you won't be able to enter the bar.

  Not much lse here, just go to the wooden fence and climb over it. There'll
be a door you can enter right in front of you

---
III.1 Car Garage

  Very straight forward. The door is to your right from when you enter. 
At the end of the hall are some bathrooms, one of which with sexual PI. 
Follow the door to a shop. Go through the employee door. Unlock the door 
(useless "puzzle") and head outside.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI, Alcoholic PI; Family PI ***

---
III.1 Streets

  Turn left and head down the street. There's nothing significant on the 
street. From here, you can go through either of two stores. If you plan on
going through the Good Old Days bar, then you have to go through Theresa's.


+--BRANCH--+

1. Clear Picture - TV Shop

	  Go down the steps and through the door. Play the recorder on the
	counter if you like. Go through the "Staff Only" door. Use the
	monitor, switch the knob to 3, and hit the release button. Look at
	the TV with the married couple for family PI.
	
	*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI (3), Family PI ***

	  Head back and go through the door behind the counter. Turn right
	and climb the fence that ironically has a "DO NOT CLIMB" sign on it.
	Go through the door ahead of you.

2. Theresa's - Dress Store

	  Play the recorder on the counter if you like. Go through the door
	behind the counter. Head up the stairs and into the room with three
	mannequins. The first mannequin you undress will have the key to the
	door. Head out that door and through the alley.
	
	*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI ***

---
III.1 Playground

  Climb the wooden fence. Turn left and go to the other side of the
wagon. Interact with the cans. These cans will be red, unless you've
made indication that you like alcohol; then they'll be green.

  Shake the cans to find one with a key inside. Just rotate the wiimote
to turn it over. Grab the key and head for the door. From here, you can
enter either the "Good 'Ol Days" bar or "52 Diner." Which one you choose
may be restricted. In most cases, you're forced to go into the diner. Don't
worry, this doesn't significantly impact anything later.

  Here is a list of factors that change the Good Old Days Bar:
  
 - Appearance: Irish Pub - True to drinks relaxing you
 - Appearance: Sports Bar - False to drinks relaxing you
 
  Entrance Criteria: 
  
 - True to making friends easily - All other questions irrelevant
 - Inspect binder in junkyard - DO NOT step on it or inspect the bear
 - Go through Theresa's - Dress choice irrelevant
 
  The conversation with the woman in the bar doesn't change. If it's a sports
bar (drinks don't relax you) she'll be wiping the counter. Otherwise, she'll be
stacking cups. That's the only difference.

  Your choices so far will affect Cybil (regardless of whether or not this is
when you first meet her. These are the general indications from the diner/Cybil.

PI Variations: 
 - Cybil Attitude - Friendliness PI
 - Cybil Outfit:- Coat & Tie - Family PI
 - Cybil Outfit - Black Fatigues - Unfriendly PI
 - Cybil Outfit - Cleavage-fest - Sexual PI
 - Sign by Door: Erotic Woman - Sexual PI
 - Sign by Door: Male - Non-sexual PI

  Go behind the counter and find the cabinet. Open the left side to find 
the first memento. Exit the building now. If you went through the bar, the
memento is in a dart board in the corner near the door.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (A Winter Beacon) ***

---
III.1 Streets

  You can now use your phone. This is where you'll find your map (D-Pad 
Left) as well as many other functions.

  If this is your second play through, you can now call the phone number to
start the UFO ending. The phone number to call is 555-3825

  Head back the way you came. Once you go through the door, turn left and 
photograph the swingset.

*** Significant Objects: Ghost (Swingset) ***

  Continue back the way you came. In the alley here, you'll find the first
UFO if you called the number. It's near a street light. Trust me, if you're
looking for it, you can't miss it. Snap a photo of that. Head into the store 
you came through (Theresa's or Clear Picture). There will be an echo message 
in the store.

** UFO **

  Once on the street in front of Theresa's/Clear Picture, you'll get a call
from Cheryl. If you don't answer it, you can't progress the game. So... 
answer it.

  This will begin the first nightmare sequence. Watch as everything in sight
is swallowed by a frozen hell.






+--------------------------+---------+
| Nightmare - Town Streets | [III.2] |
+--------------------------+---------+

  There's a car with it's alarm going off and lights flashing. The lights
are shining right on the door you need to go through.

  Watch the cutscene, then turn off your flashlight (+ button). This will 
let you avoid the first few enemies.

  The path in this nightmare is fairly straightforward. Just keep looking
for the bright blue borders and run for them. Take a look at your map and draw
a line to generally reflect these directions:
 
 - West (straight) all the way to the west side of the dark red block
 - South to cross into main dark red block
 - East to curved hallway

  When you get to the part where you're looking at a building with an alley
on either side. Aim at each alley, one will cause less static, go for that
one. The other will have an enemy right behind it.

  Don't bother hiding in the cabinet.

  In the hall with the movable objects, head for the crawlspace. The path
through the door has more enemies in it.

  At one point you'll find yourself in a locker room. This is where the
separate paths collide. The door you want has a nicely placed exit sign
above it. In each case, it will be to your left as you enter the room.

  Drop down into the pool to grab the flare, then head for the double-doors
with the exit sign. If you get confused, it's the one near the part of the
pool that looks broken.

  Continue along the straightforward path. It's not much further before you're 
done.

  If you made the best choices, you won't have a problem with the enemies
and won't even need the flare.






o+- Therapy - Happy Family -+o

Question				Primary Influence

1. Would you consider yourself		Friendliness PI
a private person?

2. Would you say it takes a while	Fake PI
for people to get to know you?

3. Would you prefer to spend time 	Family PI
with friends over family?


  Coloring Time! The colors you use will be reflected on the house you see
in the following cutscene. This has no bearing on anything else. Coloring
the trees does nothing. The doctor doesn't change his comment no matter
what you do. Leaving the page blank results in the same as coloring
everything in solid black.

  Once you're finished this therapy session, you'll watch a cutscene. In 
this cutscene, the couple's attitude is influenced by your previous actions.
The more friendly you are, the more hostile they are and vice versa.

  Following this, Cybil will show up and take you poor confused Harry away.
Cybil's conversation will similarly reflect your hostility.

---
III.1 Car Ride

  In the car, if you bounce around and play with the doors, Cybil will
comment that you seem restless. Otherwise, she'll mention you seem quiet. You
might also notice that Cybil's not wearing her seatbelt!!

  After driving for a bit, Cybil will stop the car due to the bad road
conditions. Hop on up to the front seat. In the glove compartment is a 
memento. Snag that, unlock the door and pull the handle. Yes, it's that
sophisticated just to open a door.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Hidden Fire) ***







+--------+---------+
| Forest | [III.3] |
+--------+---------+

  Once you get out of the car, there's a phone number on the hood you can
call if you'd like. Head down the road, avoiding any reindeer crossing
and hop over the fence to your left. 

  As you approach the cabin, you'll get static from the box next to the 
window. Approach to get the echo message. There's also a number in the
box you can call if you're interested.

---
III.3 Cabin

  Once you enter the cabin, there's a first aid box to your immediate
right. Inside it is a key. Looking at the map, you can get an idea of
what's around. Though you can see the same thing on your phone (D-Pad Left).

---
III.3 Forest Path

  Follow the path until you notice a water tower off to your left. Run up
to the water tower. There's a box on one side of it with a memento in it.

  Follow the static until you find the echo message. It's associated with
a wreath pinned to a tree. Nearby is a barrel in the snow.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Frozen Waters); Echo ***

  Approach the fence nearby and follow it south-east towards another fence
that you can climb over. Don't climb it, just continue following the wall.

  You'll find yourself at a fishing lodge. Go through the door and look at the
roof near the door. If you're on the UFO mission, there will be one here through
a hole in the roof.

** UFO **

  Continue through the door. Climb out the window to your right and out the
door on the other side of the dock.

  Follow the path for a little bit until you come to the wall short enough for
you to climb. Climb up it. You'll start getting static from a sleeping bag
that's on the ground just ahead.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

  Continue down this path and you'll come to a ladder that goes down into the
ground. Down the ladder, you can find a ghost, but there's nothing else down
there. For the ghost, just climb down, hop over the pipe and walk to the end
of the path. The ghost is behind the bars here. If you go through the tunnel
you'll end up back near the beginning.

*** Significant Objects: Ghost (Drowning Boy) ***
  
  From the ladder, head for the path beside the river and go left (east) 
along it. The other direction will lead back to where you came from and only 
be counter-productive.

   After a short run, you'll come to another cabin. This one's bigger 
than the last and has two doors. Which you go through doesn't really 
matter, since you can still go back and through the other.

---
III.3 Hunter's Cabin

  Going through the front door will lead you to a room with stuffed
animals. One of the rooms here may change according to your PI. You may 
encounter a stuffed bear standing as normal, or you may encounter a slaughtered
bear on a table. Then next room will have a cupboard with a memento inside as
well as a collection of condoms around the trash can.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (A Moveable Feast); Sexual PI ***

  Going through the back/side door will lead you to a butcher's room. Take
a photo of the ghost hanging over the table. There's also a sexual poster on
the wall and a cupboard, but it bears nothing significant. In the next room is
a small desk with a drawer you can open to find a memento.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (A Broken Ward); Ghost (Deer); Sexual PI ***

  Once you go through the cabin via either direction, you will come out
the back where you can enter the other door and collect what you missed.


  As soon as you come out the back, look along the wall of the cabin. There is
a canoe and a few barrels. On top of one of the barrels is a UFO. Turning off
your light makes it more noticeable.

** UFO **

---
III.3 Forest Path; continued pt.2

  As you walk away from the hunter's cabin, Cybil will call you to
reprimand you for fleeing the vehicle. Pz.

  You'll also get some static as you approach the footbridge. It's coming
from a skull pinned to a tree, which will be to your left as you approach
the footbridge.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

  Cross the river/footbridge and head left along the path. You'll come to
yet another cabin with a truck outside of it. There's a "How's my driving?"
phone number on the truck. Go to the left side of the cabin to find a 
coat on the ground with blood around it and a pink handbook on the table. 
Inside the pink handbook is a key to the cabin.

  Once inside this cabin, you'll quickly notice a shade at the end of it. 
As soon as you approach this shade, the next nightmare sequence will begin.






+--------------------+---------+
| Nightmare - Forest | [III.4] |
+--------------------+---------+

  Turn around and head out the door. If you get to it before it freezes, 
you won't be able to open it. Just wait for it to freeze and try again.

  Throughout this nightmare sequence, there's always a light in the distance
point you in the right direction.

  Once outside, run forward and follow the barriers/trees/etc to your right.
You'll end up back at the hunter's cabin and only one door is accessible.

  As soon as you go through this door, an enemy will spawn outside the
cabin, so start running. If you hide under the bed, it'll wander around
and eventually pull you out.

  Don't bother shutting off your light here, it won't help. As you run, 
stay a bit to the left, even if it means running into an enemy.

  You'll shortly notice a ledge you can climb. Climb it. There's a flare
up there.

  When you get to the area where you're running amongst trees, look for 
the movable objects. They look like some kind of mummy or wicker man.
These are the only movable objects in this nightmare sequence.

  When you come to a spot where you can go left through a door, or straight
through a set of double-doors, go through the double-doors and keep 
running forward, knocking over the movable objects as you go.

  After a little bit of leaping over gaps, you'll be forced to turn right. 
Drop down the ledge and look to your left. There's a cabin there.

  Once you're in the cabin's living room, you'll get lots of static from 
an echo. You have to approach this echo in order to get the message
related to the puzzle here.


o+- Puzzle - Music Box -+o

  The message you receive from the echo in the same room is your hint to
solving the puzzle. The solution has always been the same for me, so I 
guess it's not actually critical to listen to the message or even get the
echo, but the static is annoying anyway.

  When you listen to the message, there will be a part that plays the tune.
The tune also has animal sounds associated with it, and the keyboard has
colors associated with it. So any of these instructions should help you:

Green - Pink - Yellow - Yellow - Blue
Duck - Owl - Parrot - Parrot - Chicken
Quack - Hoot - Squawk - Squawk - Cluck
A# - G - A - A - D (for those who are musically inclined)

  Once you play the right tune, the door will thaw and you can proceed.


  For this next area, stay towards the left again. You'll notice an
airplane. No clue how it would end up stuck like that, but this is
Silent Hill...

  A little past the airplane, you'll see a flare. Run towards it and 
keep going down the path that way. Throw down the movable object and run 
through the door.

  You'll go through another door, and then you'll be in a large hall. The
door you want to go out is around the corner to your left. It has a bench
in front of it that you can hop over. This is likely the area you'll get 
grabbed by the creatures. Just light your flare and carry on.

  Once you come back out into the forest, stay to the right side. Knock
over the movable object for good measure. You'll come to a slope in the 
ground that has a door in it. Burst through the door, climb up the ledge
and follow the one-way path.

  You'll end up outside again. To your forward-left are some some stairs
leading to a cabin. Head on up there and through the door. From here
there is only one last door before you are abruptly returned to the normal
world.


---
III.4 Post-Nightmare

  If you turn around, the door will be locked and there's a latin phrase
on a banner above it. It reads: "QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT."  There are a few
things this may be in reference to. The translation is: "Who is this that
cometh?" This phrase appears in:

 - The Bible - Isaiah 63:1
 	- Kudos to Byakuya Truelight
 	
 - Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You - Ghost story
 	- http://ghost.new-age-spirituality.com/mrjames9a.html
 	- Kudos to Steve P. and Wolfgar L.


  Follow the road until you come across a red car. In the trunk is a 
memento and in the open passenger's seat is a ghost. 

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Pinned Beauty); Ghost (Hot and Bothered) ***

  Continue along the road to a small cabin. Hop the counter and go through
the door.

  Continue as obvious; under the barbed-wire fence and over the next fence. 
then turn to your right and start towards those bleachers.

  Cybil will call you (you can't ignore it). Once the conversation's done, 
you'll be returned to therapy.

III.5 Football Field

  Turn to your left and look at the goal posts. There's a big UFO between
them for you to take a picture.

** UFO **

  Run in the direction you're facing. You'll find a door that's locked. To
get the key, follow the path around the corner to a windows. All you have
to do is open the window and grab the keys. Keys in hand, head back to the
door and go inside.


---
III.5 Tammy's Hallway

  There's a cupboard here with a "Dangerous Chemicals" label. I just
wanted to point out this cupboard, because it's useless and serves no
purpose, save for the comic relief of a dead rat inside. You might
think this influences to suggest that you're a tidy/messy character, but
I haven't noticed significant change at all from this cupboard.

*** Insignificant Objects: Chemicals Cupboard ***

  There's also a bong on one of the shelves. Harry might comment on it.

  In the next hallway, you'll find a poster of the cheerleaders, each with
a designated number and their faces scratched off. There's also a number
on the wall that you can call for sexual PI..The number is 555-7588.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI ***

---
III.5 Outside School

  Once you come through the door, you'll start getting static immediately.
It's coming from the poster on the wall warning about a choking game. 
There's also a map with a path drawn on it to show where to go.

  Continue forward, you'll come to an alleyway and a "Wonderland" burger
joint. The alleyway leads to a burlesque house of some kind. Skip to
the "Wonderland" section below if you choose not to go that way. You can go
through both, which I recommend if you want all the ghosts/mementos.


---
III.5 Cathouse

  The name of this place will vary. I've seen The Honey Trap; The Cathouse; 
and Oriental Lotus  Anyway, once you climb over the wall next to Wonderland, 
just walk forward and you'll find the entrance to your left. There's nothing
else in this area, besides a sexual poster on the wall and a phone 
number for the club's booking line.


*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI ***
  

  Once inside, you'll notice plenty of sexual posters. If you're aiming for
a sexual profile, then take your time getting a nice look at each one. 
They all bear a girl in leather with butterfly wings.

  Head through the door and you'll be in the bar/lobby area. There's more
sexual posters and plenty of booze, although I've never had Harry comment
on any of it to know for sure which ones are significant.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI (8); Alcoholic PI

  Before you head upstairs, you would do well to notice and photograph
the ghost sitting on the couch.

*** Significant Objects: Ghost (Almost Had It); Sexual PI (2); ***
*** Memento (Suffocated Forever) ***

  After you grab the memento, head through the door next to it. On the roof
to your right is the fifth UFO. Snap a photo of it if it's there and jump 
across the gap. The door here leads to the second floor of the Wonderland
Burger Joint


---
III.5 Wonderland

  In the dining room is an echo from one of the tables. In the kitchen area
there's another one, coming from a coat and hat hanging up. If you're after 
the UFOs, go upstairs and out the door. The UFO is on the roof to your left 
as you exit. Also be sure to open the fridge and grab the memento there.

** UFO **

*** Significant Objects: Echo (2); Memento (My Plastic Perfect Girl) ***

  Once you grab the memento, head out the back door. You'll hop over a 
barrier and start hearing static. The echo is associated with the car.
To the left, you'll find a windows. Normally you'd think you just open it,
but you have to pull out the four nails first.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***


---
III.5 School Pt.1

  Once through the nailed window, go through the door. In this next area is 
a memento in a cupboard, as well as a ghost hanging from the coat rack.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Heavenly Protection); Ghost (Choker)

  As soon as you step through the next door, your phone will start to get
static from a shade/echo to your right. In this direction is also a 
trophy case. If you're aiming for the jock outfit, be sure to have a gander
at the trophy case. From here you can either go right out into the 
courtyard or down the hall to "Room 4D."

*** Significant Objects: Echo; Jock Outfit Influence ***

  There's nothing significant in the classroom. In most cases, there will
be a projection of a warning about mosquitoes. In other cases, it will
show a picture of Samael from SH1 or info about gonorrhea.

  Anyway, once your done in the hall/classroom, head out to the courtyard.


---
III.5 Courtyard

  In the middle of this area is a statue with a UFO above it. From the right
angle/distance, it kind of looks like a hat.

** UFO **

  There's an echo in this area. It's on a table near the south wall. 
Looking at the map, it's just above the word "School" in "Midwich School
Gym." After getting this, head to the door to the part on the side of the 
'D' block on the map. You can see the door as a black dot on the map.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***


---
III.5 School Pt.2

  Once inside, you'll be in a cloakroom. Go through the next door to
enter the classroom. Walking straight, a shade will crawl out in front
of you and run off. If you're aiming for the jock or bully outfit, don't
look closely at anything in here.

  Go through the double-doors to enter a different classrom. This one's
obviously for biology. One of the front desks will have an interactive
object on it. It's a frog you can cut open and get the memento.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (A Frigid Jewel) ***

  Head further into the school (into the D block) through the door at 
the front of the class. The other door leads back outside. Up the stairs
you'll find yourself in front of a sign pointing to an Art Studio and a
Planetarium. Neither choice will significantly impact anything later,
so choose whichever interests you


+--BRANCH--+

1. Art Studio

	  Walk up to the shelf with all the sculptures on it. Other 
	than this, there's nothing else significant in the room.

	o+- Puzzle - Shadows -+o
	
	Quick Solution: Call 555-8465
	
	  The idea is to arrange the objects to create a phone number.
	Although the solution is always the same, to solve it, you
	want to pick up the two sculptures on the left and place them
	so their shadows vaguely form an 8. The next sculpture doesn't 
	need to be moved, it's a 4. The next two swan sculptures, when
	placed together resemble a 6. Finally, turn the pipe and clamp
	as far as they go to the right. This forms a 5.
	
	  So the number is 555-8465. Get out your phone and go to the
	dialer (D-pad Up). Call the number and you'll get a message
	that the door's open now. The voice will change, I'm not sure
	what influences the voice.
	
	  Head behind the curtain and through the door.
	

2. Planetarium

	o+- Puzzle - Planetarium -+o
	
	Quick Solution: Call 555-2327

	  Walk down the aisle to the right from the door. There's an 
	echo coming from one of the seats. Listen to the message, 
	it's an instructor who mentions the Little Bear (Ursa Minor)
	constellation. This is your hint that you need to look at
	this constellation.
	
	  Go to the desk and hit the lower button to turn on the 
	machine. Then go to the projector and rotate it until you 
	find the right constellation. If you're not familiar with it,
	there's	a picture on the wall you can check. The Ursa Minor
	constellation will also have the brightest star.
	
	  Once you have Ursa Minor in your view, go back to the desk
	and press the upper button. It'll light up the constellations
	and also a message. The message says to call 555-2327. Once 
	you do, the door to proceed will unlock.
	
---
III.5 Hall to Gym

  Once you come out from the planetarium or art studio, go around the 
corner and down the steps (you can't enter the other room). At the 
a shade will run across and you'll get a text message from Dahlia. 
This is an indicator of your current PI.

PI Variations:
 - Mini skirt and pink top - Sexual PI
 - Green vest - Alcoholic PI
 - Black/purple outfit - Family PI
 
 
o+- Puzzle - Gym Keycode -+o

Quick Solution: The keycode is: 1031

  Head to the door at the end of the hall to your right. There's a 
keypad next to it with a number scratched into it. This number is
the locker number that has the key code inside of it. It'll always
be 1053.

  Turn around and go to the end of the hall to get the echo from the
poster on the corkboard. The locker with the code is near this poster
on the left side (as you face the poster). In the locker, you might
be confused at first, then you'll notice the photo of two football
players. One has the number 10 and the other is 31. Thus, you 
would do well to figure that as the keycode.

  Across the hall from this locker is a locker with a memento 
inside. Be sure to grab that, then head to the keypad. Put in the
code (1031) and go through the door.

*** Significant Objects: Echo, Memento (An Eternal Rose) ***

  You'll be outside again. If you're after UFOs, there's one here in a tree
near the wall to your right. It's kinda small and blends in a little with 
the branches, but you should be able to find it ok. Just outside the gym doors
is an echo coming from balloons to your right. Get it, then go into the gym.

** UFO **

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

  Walk through the tables towards the stage and a series of 
cutscenes will begin.

PI Variations:
 - Michelle in pink dress - Family PI
 - Michelle in red dress, hair down - Sexual PI
 - Michelle in brown dress - Uncertain
 - Michelle hops down into your arms - Sexual PI
 - Comments about secretary - Friendliness PI


o+- Puzzle - PC Password -+o

  Once the cutscene ends, you'll be attempting to crack the
principal's computer. Even if you know the answer, you have to use 
the forgotten password tool. Click on the "forgotten password" link. 
This will prompt you with three random questions of the following. 
The answers are all found somewhere in the office.

**Note: The "-" button is a hotkey for backspace here.

Wasted three years of my life in order major in?
 - "Geology"
 - Diploma on wall behind computer desk
 
I said goodbye to bachelorhood, freedom and happiness, where?
 - "Hawaii"
 - Framed photo on shelf behind the computer desk
 
The greatest baseball team, without question?
 - "Shiners"
 - Hat on chair in front of desk

 - "Scorpio"
 - Astrology poster behind secretary's desk
 - Birthday posted on calendar near secretary's desk
 
The king of sports, a man's game of squash?
 - "Racquetball"
 - Trophy mounted on wall
 
My bitch of an ex-wife's name?

 - "Otto"
 - Signed drawing on floor near computer desk
 
Probably the best Shakespeare comedy?
 - "Twelfth Night"
 - Book found in bookcase in corner of office, across from computer
 
 
  After you answer the questions, the password will be set to "sunday45" 
which you can now use to unlock the computer. Once unlocked, a cutscene
will start, leading to a nightmare sequence. If you pay attention, you might
also have noticed on the computer screen the name "Cheryl Heather Mason." hmm..

+--------------------+---------+
| Nightmare - School | [III.5] |
+--------------------+---------+

  Turn off your flashlight and get your map out. The path I'd
recommend taking goes like this:
 - C block
 - Parking
 - D block
 - Small block on east side of D block
 - Hall next to "Adm"


---
III.5 Paparazzi Game

  Once you approach the ice statues, you'll get a message. Rest
here for a moment if you're hurt. As you leave, you'll get a text
message about prime paparazzi spots. Each of the locations are lit
with a flashing red light.

  Take a look at your map. The path I recommend goes like this:
 - Grab flare
 - Snap photo 
 - Small block on east side of D block
 - D block
 - Parking lot - Near 'a' in "Parking"
 - Snap photo
 - South towards F block
 - Snap photo
 - Gym
 - Out north Gym door
 - Head east, back to the hall next to "Adm"
 
  If you're ever about to take a picture, but your flare is lit or the
creatures are too close, you can drop your flare with + which will keep them
away while you take the photo.

  Once you come out the door, any of the creatures that had been following 
you will be gone. You'll also find the flare and the flashing red light. 
You wanna photograph the ice statues you can see through the wall in 
the red light.

  The next location you wanna head for is the parking lot. There's a car 
there with a flashing red light. On the map, it's right by the 'a' in 
"Parking."

  The third photo spot is next to the door to the F block on the map. 
This one is another ice statue through a hole in the wall.

  Once you've returned to the blocked door, the ice statues blocking it will 
shatter and you'll get a text message for each.

  When you come out the door, a cutscene will take place.
  
---
III.5 Post-Nightmare

  Just follow Michelle as normal. If you're aiming for sexual PI, stare 
at her ass and admire the sway of her hips.

  You'll eventaully come to the Balkan Club. Its color scheme will vary between
red, purple/blue, and hardwood. You are free to wander around, but there's 
nothing interesting anywhere here.

  Go through the door and head up the stairs. You'll find yourself in front of 
a door with stars, and a door with lips. They both lead to the same room. As 
you'd expect, the lips door has sexual PI associated with it.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI ***

  You'll also get a text message from Dahlia. This message is an indicator of 
your current PI.

Indicator Variations:
 - Thirsty - Alcoholic PI
 - Horny - Sexual PI
 - Bored - Family PI

  In the room, you'll find several objects you can search. Michelle will yell
something based on the first object you touch. The funniest one is if you open
the cupboard in the corner first; she'll tell you not to steal her cookies :-p

  The keys will appear in the third object you search. Keys in hand, head back 
to Michelle (the door you didn't open will be locked).

  Once you get back, you'll have a series of cutscenes. If you're aiming to 
come off as alcoholic, stare at the booze.

---
III.5 Traveling With Dahlia

  When the cutscene finishes, jump the railing and climb the ladder. Inside, 
you'll find a cabinet and the bridge controls. In the cabinet is a phone 
number (555-3411) you can call for instructions on what to do. Or you can 
just continue reading :-)


o+- Puzzle - Bridge Control -+o

  Use the controls and read the following before hitting the red button. A 
light will come on and you need to pull the associated lever. The lights are 
as follows:

 - Green: Nothing; just wait a moment
 - Blue: Middle lever
 - Red: Left lever
 - Yellow: Right lever
 
  Once you've followed four correct sequences, the bridge will start to move. 
Head back to the car to continue.

---
III.5 Drowning

*** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING ***

  If you touch the radio before it starts flashing, you may cause a glitch to 
occur that will trap you in the car, forcing you to drown.

*** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING ***


  This is my favorite part of the game besides the ending. It effectively 
conveys how it feels to drown; helpless. You don't have to do anything for a 
while; just wait.

  Once you hit the bottom your flashlight will float up in front of one of 
the seats. Move over to it and grab it.

  Move to the front seat once you have the flashlight and look out the window.

  After a moment, the radio will start flashing. Turn it on and the ice will 
go away. Now, you'll be able to escape. Unlock and open the door or open the 
window. Either will let you get out.

  Of course, you can also let yourself drown. It doesn't end the game. It takes 
about 60 seconds.

*** Significant Objects: Fake PI ***






+---------------------+---------+--------+
| How You Want To Die | [III.7] | [IV.4] |
+---------------------+---------+--------+

  You'll be in therapy again. The doctor will comment about how he figures 
you'd like to die. This is an obvious indicator of your PI.

PI Variations:
 - "Surrounded by family" - Family PI
 - "Having sex" - Sexual PI
 - "In your sleep" - Fake PI
 - "Drink yourself to death" - Alcoholic PI
 
  For the task of dividing the pictures, I have yet to notice any significant 
influence from any of the different distributions.

  If you put all the pictures on one side, he'll comment that he figured you'd
catch it as a trick question. If you divide the photos, whichever side you
put fewer on, he'll say they all are (If you put mostly dead, he'll say they're 
all sleeping and vice versa).


---
III.7 Wheelchair Escape

  You'll be in a new outfit that reflects your previous choices. This is
generally gives you an idea what you're heading for so far. The only
significant one is the hooded tan coat. If you don't have it, then you likely
won't be getting the Wicked and Weak ending.

PI Variations:
 - Pink shirt / brown coat - No particular indication
 - Black leather jacket - You said yes to bully
 - Hooded tan coat - Wicked and Weak Ending indication
 - Green letterman coat - You've suggested that you are a jock

  If you just sit here, nothing happens, so you don't actually need to rush. 
Nonetheless, just flick the wiimote and nunchuk together to move the quickest.

  Once you fall out of the wheelchair, get your map out. You'll notice a
yellow line to the east of your current location. Just above that yellow 
line is a gray block with two doors. That is where you want to head.

  I get there by going across the train field, then going straight east, 
grabbing the flare. When you come out of the train cars into the yard 
again,  duck underneath the car to your left.and climb the ledge to go through 
the door on your right.

  Follow this one-way path until you jump over the second fence. Once you jump 
over it, you'll be facing a set of double-doors. DON'T go in those. Doors, 
they loop backwards. Turn right and you should see the doors you want to go 
through.


o+- Puzzle - Radio Request -+o

Quick Solution: 555-8814 for "Daddy's Girl"

  After a little more running, you'll end up in a hospital room and get a 
voicemail. Turn on the radio.

  Zoom in on the radio (B) and grab the knob (B+A) and turn it to about 102. 
The DJ will loop, talking about calling in to request a song. The song you 
want to request is Daddy's Girl (4). So dial 555-8814.

  After calling, you just wait a moment for the song to come on and then the
ice on the door will melt away. You can han gup the phone as soon as your call
gets connected; you don't have to listen to the DJ recording on your phone.

  Head through the door. The ice will fade away before your eyes as you follow
the hallway. This will lead to a cutscene.

III.8 Time With Lisa

  Follow Lisa. If you want more sexual PI, stare at her ass while walking. When 
you get to the apartment, you can choose to sit and watch TV or check out Lisa
while she's changing.

  She'll ask you to get her some pills. Head into the bathroom and check the
vanity for a memento inside a music box. Then open the cupboard and get the
pill. If you want unfriendly PI, then purposely grab the wrong color
of pill. Otherwise, just grab the color she asked for.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI (2); Friendliness PI; ***
*** Memento (Infinit Jest) ***

**Note: Giving Lisa the wrong pill is the most significant unfriendly PI in 
the game



o+- Therapy - Guilty Conscience -+o

  The doctor will talk about guilt and how it stresses people out. He'll then
tell you a short story about four characters and ask you to align the
characters according to how guilty they are.

  Basically the story goes like this:
 - Some guy wants to marry a princess
 - He asks permission from the King
 - Princess doesn't want to marry him, but King agrees; following protocol
 - Buddy tries to seduce her
 - She runs away into a field that's dangerous
 - Bull tramples princess to death (Owned)
 
  Typically, I just leave the characters where they are. I have yet to
determine a specific link this has with future events.

  Here is what the doctor will comment according to who you declare as the
most culpable.
  
 - Bull - "You couldn't ignore the facts. He was the one who killed her."
 - Princess - "She didn't have to run away, did she?"
 - King - "You think he should've ignored protocol."
 - Wilhelm - "You think if he really loved her, he wouldn't have forced the
 marriage."
 

---
III.8 After Meeting Lisa

  Head out of Lisa's apartment. There's a metal grate that you have to manually
open, then you'll be able to get outside.

  From here, there are two paths you can take. The one is to your left and goes
straight into the mall. The other is up ahead and goes in through the
receiving and warehouse area. The receiving/warehouse area has a memento, so
I usually take that way. If you want, you can even go in one way, and then
leave through the other.

+--BRANCH--+

1. Warehouse

	  Head up the street from Lisa's apartment building. There's a fence
	you can climb over on the left side of the street. Once you climb over,
	you'll notice a collection of cargo containers. There's nothing around
	them, so turn to your left and climb the one in the corner. It's the
	only container that'sby itself.
	
	  Go through the window and into the next room. In here are two
	photocopiers. One of them has a memento in it, the other has nothing.
	
	*** Significant Objects: Memento (Synthetic Femur) ***
	
	  You'll also get a text message from Michelle about how she's still

	waiting for her boyfriend to show up. From this, you can either take
	friendly or unfriendly PI. For friendly, call her. For unfriendly, do 
	nothing; just carry on as normal.
	
	*** Significant Objects: Friendliness PI ***
	
	  After coming through the door into the warehouse, you'll hear the
	sound of something falling. Nothing's around though. Head down the
	stairs and up the other set of stairs to doorwith a green sign above it.
	
	  Make your way up the stairwell and out the door.
	  
2. Mall Entrance

	  Head to your left as you come out of Lisa's apartment, and around
	the corner. Here you'll find a door to the mall's car park entrance.
	Head inside, up the escalator and through the door. After crawling
	under the shutters, head to the corner up ahead. There's a funny sign
	hanging off the security camera in the corner.
	
	  You'll also get a text message from Michelle about how she's still
	waiting for her boyfriend to show up. From this, you can either take
	friendly or unfriendly PI. For friendly, call her. For unfriendly, do 
	nothing; just carry on as normal.
		
	*** Significant Objects: Friendliness PI ***
	
	  Head out the door when you're done; nothing else here.

---
III.8 Nurse In Distress
	  
  From this area, you can go through the other branch if you wish. There's also
a UFO you can see from the bridge to the north. Just stand at the railing and 
look down at the road. Once you approach the mall entrance, Lisa will call you 
for help. You can't continue into the mall (the door will be locked). So head 
back to Lisa's.

** UFO **

  Once you get back to Lisa's apartment, a cutscene will begin. It will be
slightly different depending on whether or not you gave her the right pill. The
end result is the same.

  As the cutscene ends, the next nightmare sequence will begin.
  

+------------------+---------+
| Nightmare - Mall | [III.9] |
+------------------+---------+

  Head outside and get out your map. The path I recommend goes like this:
 - Warehouse door (not towards the Offices)
 - East out to the gray area
 - Grab flare and head up the stairs
 - Follow obvious path until you reach the statue of the bird
 - Go into the store that the bird is facing; mannequins in display window
 - On the roof, go left and knock over the tower as you pass it
 - Enter the stairwell at the corner of the roof and continue as normal
 
  You'll find yourself in a room with a gumball machine.
  
  
o+- Puzzle - Gumball Machine -+o

Quick Solution: Purple, pink, red, yellow

  As the voicemail vaguely suggests, the colors the girl likes are the colors
of the cartoon bird's beak. To change the color of the current gumball, grab
the sphere and shake it. You don't have to get the colors in any order, just
as long as you get each of them.

  The colors you want are: purple, pink, red, and yellow. Try not to mistake the
black for purple.


---
III.9 Toluca Mall

  After solving the puzzle, you'll get another voicemail. Head through the door.
There will be a partly open shutter in front of you. As you approach it, a
message will appear.
 
  Crawl under the shutter and look across the way. There's a store there called
"Pageturners." Near it is a garbage can. This garbage can has an echo on it.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

  After getting the echo, head for the store titled: "Family Pet."
  

---
III.9 Family Pet

  If you've been building unfriendly PI, this place will be trashed. In here is 
both a memento and echo. The echo is in a dog cage in the corner. The memento 
is inside a hamster cage on display near the register. You have to turn the 
two screws to open it

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Memories Undeveloped); Echo ***

  There's also a UFO in one of the fish tanks. If you can't find it, turn off 
your light. That should make it easier to see. When done, jump over the 
counter and into the back area. 

** UFO **

  You'll be in a back hall. Just walk through. A shade will come out from
behind some garbage and run away. You'll get a text message about mystery
shoppers being employed to ensure the mall's values are upheld (which will vary
based on your PI). Head through the door at the end of the hall.

---
III.9 Toy Store

  There's a safe you'll notice right away. Thankfully, you don't have to crack
more than one number. Just turn it to around 70 and you should here it click
open. Then pull the handle and grab the memento.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (My Flying Lizard) ***

  Walk over to the train set and turn it on. It'll start going round and round
until you change the track (which you can't change back). Then it'll crash. A
key falls out when it crashes. Grab it and head out of the store.

  Go up the escalators to your left and through the exit door. You'll be in a
back hall, with a mannequin in it.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI ***

  When you come out through the door, there will be some tropical music playing,
coming from the giant bird in the middle. Walk around for a bit and Michelle
will call you. There's also an echo down one of the corridors.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

  From here, you can choose to go in either the "Celebration Time Gift Shop" or
the "New Looks" hair salon. Neither holds anything significantly different.

+--BRANCH--+

1. New Looks Hair Salon

	  Walk up to the sinks and turn them on, also turn the temperature of
	the water to as hot as possible. This will fog the mirror and reveal
	a message there. I laughed at the one message. The code is always the
	same, which is 1789. Enter that in the keypad and head out the back.
	
2. Celebration Time Gift Shop

	  There's an echo coming from the keypad here. It gives you the hint
	for figuring out the code.
	
	o+- Celebration Time Code -+o
	
	Quick Solution: The code is 2050
	
	  Listen to the message. There will be two sound clips played. What
	you have to do is find the cards in the store that play those sounds. 
	
	  The first card is for a 20th anniversary. The second card is for a
	50th birthday. Note the numbers: 20 and 50. Punch those in the keypad
	and head through the door.
	
	
  Once you leave the store, you'll be in another back hallway. In this hallway
is an echo from on top of a garbage can and a locker with a confiscated knife
inside. Get the echo, head through the proceeding door and up the stairs.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

III.9 Photographic Memory

  You'll be in the employee area of a photo development store. Jump over the
counter and you'll start getting static for the echo in the corner. There's also
a corkboard with some nice pictures on it.

*** Significant Objects: Echo; Friendly PI ***

---
III.9 Cinereal Movie Theater

  Right about now you'll probably think to yourself: "It's been a long time
since I saw any of those ghosts. Did I miss them?" Nope, but there's one here.
You should notice a bench with some cleaning items and cones around it. There's
a ghost sitting there for you to take a photo.

*** Significant Objects: Ghost (Not Her Fault) ***

  You'll notice the title of the movie playing on the sign outside the doors.
The movie title is reflective of your current PI.

PI Variations:
 - "Dearest Mother" - Unfriendly PI
 " "The Dancer" - Sexual PI
 - "Together Forever" - Family PI
 - "Good Poison" - Alcoholic PI
 
  As soon as you enter the theater, stop what you're doing and admire the
arcades to your right. That's right... CONTRA. Harry will even comment "some 
real classics." Wait... it's broken?!?! Blasphemy!! It is now your personal 
mission to find who destroyed this machine!!

  Anyway... there's a toy machine against  The wall across the lobby. Inside is
a memento. All you have to do is press the two buttons and you'll get it.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (The Modern Prometheus); Contra ***

  Head down the hall to the auditorium. Once in the auditorium, your phone will
start going off with static. As you walk towards the screen, some images of
Harry and Cheryl will appear.

  Walk up to the screen and they'll go away. You can unplug your ears from the
loud static now. If you had your flashlight off, once the static ends, Harry
would've turned it on. Glitch? Whatever. Go out the door with an exit sign.

  Follow the hallway, you'll get a text message from Dahlia. Head out the door
and you'll be on the streets of Silent Hill, once again.


---
III.9 Streets Outside Toluca Mall

  Scale the fence and turn to your right. Head down the street to the corner and
stop. There's a car across the street and behind it is a ghost on the ground.
Snap a photo of it before you continue.

*** Significant Objects: Ghost (Dead Dog) ***

  There's a graphical glitch here too. It's in the window of the TV store. As
you walk in front of the display case, you'll notice a TV and section of the
wall behind it vanish.

  Continue down the street and you'll come to a the "Green Lion" pawn shop.
  

---
III.9 Green Lion Pawn Shop

  This building will reflect your current PI as follows:
  
PI Variations:
 - Green with dragon on sign - Alcoholic PI
 - Red with mannequins in window - Sexual PI
 - Purple with lion on sign - Family PI
 
  As you enter, there's a UFO on a shelf to your left. Snap a photo of it.
  
** UFO **
 
  Approach the counter and interact with it. To get the key you have to turn
the screw thing on the left side and then pull the turn-table. With the key,
head through the door and turn right to go behind the register, where there's
a memento in a box.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (We, Ouroboros) ***

  Head to the back and up the stairs to start a cutscene, which ends with a
nightmare sequences.


+---------------------+----------+
| Nightmare - Nowhere | [III.10] |
+---------------------+----------+

  Turn around and walk out the door. Follow the path down the steps and you'll
eventually come to a dead end where you have to jump down.

  As you fall, you'll notice some images of Harry and Cheryl on the wall.
  
  You'll land in an empty area with a chair. turn around until you see some
boards on the ground. Walk over to those boards and you should start to get
some static from your left. Point yourself in the direction where it's the
loudest and follow the static to a hanging lamp. Believe me, I've scoured
this area; there's nothing.

  You'll be in a hall with two doors. They both lead to the same place, so pick
whichever you feel like. Then you'll be in a room with a couch, TV, and doors
on each wall. Again, which door you choose doesn't matter.

  Pick a door and go down the stairs. At the bottom, you'll get static coming
from a mirror on the wall. As you approach it you'll transition again.

---
III.10 Confusing Halls

  This next sequence of hallways is easy to get lost in, but it's very easy if
you know where to go. Once you're through the very first door, you'll be in a
corridor with several doors/halls. The door to your right, with the lamp above 
it is where you want to go. Once through that, you should be in an open room
with a few doors. Only one of them has a lamp over it. It's the second on the
right as you enter. This is the exit.
 
  This is the shortest path possible. If you get lost, the second-last door is 
a bit difficult to find, but it has some unique characteristics. It has a lamp
above it. It's in the long halls; not one of the rooms with multiple exits. The
walls around it look different; they seem more jagged and broken than the rest.

  You'll find yourself in an empty area with only a door. The door you came
through vanishes. Just run over to the door and go through it.

  Make your way through the rooms as they change in a really neat way. You'll
eventually find yourself at another dead end to jump off.

---
III.10 Hall of Glass

  You'll land in an area that appears to be completely open, with an obvious
destination. However, the walls are invisible. Use your flashlight to look at
the shadows and keep track of where the walls are and make your way around to
the bed.

  As soon as you approach it, you'll find yourself in another series of halls
filled with creatures. This is the most difficult nightmare sequence. All the
halls and rooms look the same and you get looped around very easily. Be sure
to knock over all the cabinets as you pass them to keep track of where you've
been.

  The path you need to take is always different, so I'm afraid I can't give
specific directions.
 
  The most identifiable exit has lots of ice around it, but it isn't thick like
some of the others. It's in a + shaped hall and the walls around it are frozen
about half way to the middle. Most of the doors with ice around them, the ice 
only goes a couple feet from the door.

  Here's a diagram of the final corridor:
  
           **EXIT**
           *      *
           *      *
           |      |
           |      |
     ______|      |_____
    |                X  |
    o                   o
    o                   o
    |__X___       ______|
           |      |
           |      |
           |      |
           |      |
           |__oo__|

|  Normal Wall     * Frozen Wall
X  Movable Object  oo Door
           
  
  It's easy to tell if you've hit a loop door, because if you don't, the
rooms will alternate between square and + shapes.
 
  There's more than one exit, which is nice, but they're still hard to find.
The ones I've been able to find have all had thick ice around them, but don't
be fooled, there are many doors with thick ice around them. The diagram above
is the most identifiable chamber with an exit. I have always entered it from
the bottom, and it's tempting to take the other paths, because you can track
your path that way with the movable objects, but you'll learn that the final
door never has a movable object in front of it.

  SAVE YOUR GAME HERE. Yes, here in the empty room with nothing but a single
door, right after the difficult nightmare sequence. This is the last place you
can save and still critically impact your ending.

  From this point, I've been able to get three different endings.

  After you SAVE your game, go through the door and you'll get a cutscene
  
  
o+- Therapy - Marriage -+o

*** THIS SECTION CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***

  The good doctor will ask you a few questions about marriage. These are the
questions he asks:

1. You think marriage can really last?

2. Should a couple stay together for the kids?

3. Do you think it's a bad idea to marry young?

4. Do you think sex becomes stale after marriage?

  Your answers here will affect the following cutscene with Michelle and John.
Basically, If you approve of marriage, John will leave Michelle. If you come off
as disapproving of marriage, Michelle will make John stop the car and run off.

  John's mood when you first meet id reflective of the opposite of your
friendliness PI. If you're particularly unfriendly, John will be happy to meet
you. Otherwise, he won't be very interested.

  This is also where you can gain some Fake PI. The best way to do this is 
simply answer "no" to each question.

  The doctor will then ask you to arrange 6 photos into married couples. You can
pair them as follows:

 - Same color clothes
 - Same background
 - Same expression
 
  Or you can just scramble them. I've never noticed any changes that I could
specifically link to these photos.

  For Fake PI, I usually make two of the couples gay, even though I don't really
think it matters.

III.11 Car Ride

  You'll wake to the lovely voice of Michelle. After the cutscene, you'll be in
a car with John and Michelle. If you have enough Unfriendly PI, then John will
thank you. Otherwise, he'll seem upset.

  The conversation that happens will change based on your answer from the last
therapy session.

  Once the car stops, move up front and open the glove box to grab the memento.
Exit the car and head for the storm drain access, callously disregarding the
"KEEP OUT" signs all around it.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Poetry as Precise as Geometry) ***

---
III.11 Sewer Access

  Make your way down into the underground tunnels. When you climb down the
ladder, you'll get a text message from Dahlia.

  Turn in to the first branch you come to. Down this way is a pipe you can
interact with. There'll be a fish there with a giant hook in its mouth. Pull
on the hook and the fish will squirm around, then vomit. In its vomit is a
memento. Kinda gross...

*** Significant Objects: Memento (A Happy Bond) ***

  As you continue through the tunnels, you'll get a call. This call is very
indicative of the ending as your PI won't change from this point on.

PI Variations:
 - "Go away!" - Unfriendly PI / Alcoholic PI
 - "Not Safe" - Family PI
 - "Need you" - Fake PI
 
  Before climbing the ladder to the exit, step back from the ladder. To the
right are some bars. Through these bars is another UFO. Photograph it.

** UFO **
 
  Climb the ladder. Spin the wheel on the door to open it. Go through the door
and up the ladder to return to the streets again.


---
III.11 Lighthouse Cove

  As you come around the corner, stay near the wall and you should notice a
weird statue. It's a statue of an indian or something and he's holding a box
of cigars. Also in the box is a memento.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Memories Untaken) ***

  Head through the square and you'll find a red car. On the hood of the car is
a map, which is an echo.

*** Significant Objects: Echo ***

  There's a "Lakefront Souvenirs" store with a red door that you can enter to
continue. It's very easy to identify on the map.

  Inside the souvenir store you'll find a memento inside a display case. Grab
it and head for the curtain at the back of the store. Open the curtain to
reveal a door.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (A Beacon, a Key) ***

  You'll be outside again. Jump the fence and turn right. Don't go into the
bar yet. Up ahead you'll find a telescope. Turn it to face the lighthouse and 
a small compartment will open up with a memento inside. Snag that, then head
for Annie's Bar. A cutscene will ensue.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Your Diamond Heart) ***








o+- Therapy - Sex Evaluation -+o

  The good doctor will task you to classify a group of abstract images as 
sexual or non-sexual. All of the images are abstract paintings of something
that represents death. Going from top to bottom here's what the images are
intended to represent.

 - Hand holding pistol
 - Dagger / knife
 - Noose
 - Rotten apple
 - Deer skull
 - Human skull
 - Totalled car
 
  If you put them all on the non-sexual side, you'll get Fake PI. All of them
on the sexual side gets you sexual PI. Otherwise, nothing really changes.

III.12 Outside Entrance


  You'll find yourself in a short hall. On the wall is a sexual poster. Head
out the door.

  Follow the road to the end. You'll find a bench with a box on it. Inside the
box is a memento. Grab that, then turn and head for the amusement park.

*** Significant Objects: Sexual PI; Memento (The Dragon) ***

  Looking at the entrance, there's a sign to your right that will change based
on your PI. Jump over the counter. Open the yellow jacket. Pull the key out
of the pocket and head through the door.

---
III.12 Park Entrance

  When you come outside on the inside of the park, you might recognize the
area from the videotape recording played at the start. To your left is the thing
where you stand behind a picture and put your face through a hole. There's a
ghost here for you to photo.

*** Significant Objects: Ghost (Dragon Slayer) ***

  Head the other way and you'll find some slot machines. Play it. Once you
pull the lever a few times, you'll win a memento.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Eve) ***

  From the slot machine, turn around and climb the wall up ahead. You'll crawl
through a hole into the "tunnel of love." Once inside, there's a shade that'll
move around and you just follow it.

  First, the shade will be on the middle swan. Then it'll be back up the ladder.
Then it'll be on the foremost swan. Then it'll run towards a door and the ice
on it will thaw.


---
III.12 Docks

  You'll find yourself outside again. Climb the fence and you'll be at the
docks. There are two docks. The one on the left is empty, unless your collecting
photos of UFOs, in which case, go to the end of it and you'll notice a UFO
trying to blend in with the light. Can't fool us! We have walkthroughs!

** UFO **

  Walk down the dock and board The Opheus. As you approach the door, a cutsene 
will begin.
  

---
III.12 Into The Light

  When the cutscene ends, head down the ladder and start running for the light.
You can run all over the place here, but there's nothing out there. Trust me :)

  Dahlia will call you. Ignore her request and press onwards. After a little
bit, you'll get a text message from Cybil. Keep running. Creatures will start 
to pursue you. You don't actua;;y have to fight them if you don't want to.

  Eventually, you'll be overwhelmed, but then the ice breaks and you'll start
swimming.

  Start swimming! Look down into the water by pressing B. There's a collection
of interesting statues at the bottom of the lake. If you're feeling lazy, or
want a little more Fake PI, just stop and let Harry drown.


---
III.12 The Lighthouse

  After the cutscene, if you're UFO hunting, turn to your right and go as far 
as you can. The final UFO is in the water just off the shore from here

** UFO **

. Once you walk up to the lighthouse. You'll see a familiar name
on the board if you've played SH1.

  Inside, turn right and you'll find a statue on a pedstal that you can open.
Inside the statue's head is a memento.

*** Significant Objects: Memento (Adam) ***

  Walk to the end of the hall and the final cutscenes will begin. Congrats,
you've beaten the game! Hope you like the ending. I know I did.

                                    --------

  These therapy sessions have a large impact on events throughout the game.
Some only affect minor details, while others affect the ending cutscenes.


+----------+--------+
| The Test | [IV.1] |
+----------+--------+

  This form is the initial psycho-profiling that happens in this game. The 
profiling influences various aspects of the game. Some affect the ending, 
while others only influence a scene or two.

  Even if you're hunting for a specific ending, they all take
influences from multiple events; don't worry about getting everytying that
contributes to a specific ending.

  Particularly for first-time players, don't worry about repercussions of
your choices, they're all minor. Just choose whatever you like.


Question			Primary Influence

1. I make friends easily	Friendliness PI

2. Having a drink helps me	Alcoholic PI; Good Ol' Days Bar
   relax

3, I always listen to other	Friendliness PI
   people's feelings

4. I prefer abstract ideas	Fake PI

5. I have enjoyed role-play	Sexual PI
   during sex			

6. Working to a plan or 	Family PI; Fake PI
   schedule is best

7. I have never cheated on a	Sexual PI
   partner




+--------------+--------+
| Happy Family | [IV.2] |
+--------------+--------+

Question				Primary Influence

1. Would you consider yourself		Friendliness PI
a private person?

2. Would you say it takes a while	Fake PI
for people to get to know you?

3. Would you prefer to spend time 	Family PI
with friends over family?


  Coloring Time! The colors you use will be reflected on the house you see
in the following cutscene. This has no bearing on anything else. Coloring
the trees does nothing. The doctor doesn't change his comment no matter
what you do. Leaving the page blank results in the same as coloring
everything in solid black.



+-----------------------------+--------+
| Halcyon Days of High School | [IV.3] |
+-----------------------------+--------+

  The doctor will say a list of titles. Your answer, combined with your
class choices afterwards will primarily influence your clothes later on.


Title		Influence

Jock. . . . . . Jock outfit
Slut		Sexual PI
Drunk . . . . . Alcoholic PI
Virgin		Fake PI
Bully . . . . . Greaser outfit; Unfriendly PI
Slacker		None


Class		Influence

Religion . . . .None
Creative Writ	None
Geography. . . .None
Literature	None
Theater. . . . .Michelle's outfit

Football	Jock outfit
Backetball . . .Jock outfit
Sex Ed		Sexual PI
Math . . . . . .None
Science		None

  Basically, if you want the jock outfit, say "yes" to jock and make sure
to include both sports in your classes. For the greaser outfit (leather
jacket) be sure to say "yes" to bully.



+---------------------+--------+
| How You Want To Die | [IV.4] |
+---------------------+--------+

  You'll be in therapy again. The doctor will comment about how he figures 
you'd like to die. This is an obvious indicator of your PI.

PI Variations:
 - "Surrounded by family" - Family PI
 - "Having sex" - Sexual PI
 - "Drink yourself to death" - Alcoholic PI
 
  For the task of dividing the pictures, I have yet to notice any significant 
influence from any of the different distributions.

  If you put all the pictures on one side, he'll comment that he figured you'd
catch it as a trick question. If you divide the photos, whichever side you
put fewer on, he'll say they all are (If you put mostly dead, he'll say they're 
all sleeping and vice versa).


+-------------------+--------+
| Guilty Conscience | [IV.5] |
+-------------------+--------+

  The doctor will talk about guilt and how it stresses people out. He'll then
tell you a short story about four characters and ask you to align the
characters according to how guilty they are.

  Basically the story goes like this:
 - Some guy wants to marry a princess
 - He asks permission from the King
 - Princess doesn't want to marry him, but King agrees; following protocol
 - Buddy tries to seduce her
 - She runs away into a field that's dangerous
 - Bull tramples princess to death (Owned)
 
  Typically, I just leave the characters where they are. I have yet to
determine a specific link this has with future events.

  Here is what the doctor will comment according to who you declare as the
most culpable.
  
 - Bull - "You couldn't ignore the facts. He was the one who killed her."
 - Princess - "She didn't have to run away, did she?"
 - King - "You think he should've ignored protocol."
 - Wilhelm - "You think if he really loved her, he wouldn't have forced the
 marriage."

   Your answers here will affect the following cutscene with Michelle and John.
 Basically, If you approve of marriage, John will leave Michelle. If you come

  The ending you get has two parts. The first, I refer to as the Encounter
Ending, and the other is the Videotape Ending. The Encounter Ending refers to
the cutscene that takes place in the therapy room, where Harry and Cheryl
finally meet. The Videotape Ending refers to the part after this.

  The reason I divide it this way, is because your PI can impact either in a
particular manner. For example, the "Drunk Dad" ending is only related to the
Videotape, and is not reflected in the Encounter. Likewise, the Hero Forever
ending is only reflected in the Encounter; not the Videotape.


+------------------+-------+
| Encounter Ending | [V.1] |
+------------------+-------+

  This is the cutscene that takes place in the therapy room. There are three
different versions you can get. As these cutscenes do not have official titles
anywhere, I've titled them as follows:

 - Broken
 - Bearer of Guilt
 - Hero Forever
 

o+- Broken -+o

How To Get It:

  Build up as much Family and Friendly PI as possible. Concentrate on finding 
Cheryl, ignoring distractions like sex and alcohol. Answer questions as an 
honest family man would.


Major PI:

 - "True" to questions: 1, 3, 6, and 7
 - "False" to questions: 2 and 5
 - "No" to spending time with friends, over family
 - "Yes" to marriage can last
 - "No" to sex becoming stale
 - Avoid sexual and alcoholic PI


Description:

  Harry kneels before Cheryl. They gaze at each other, unsure of how to say 
goodbye. "You've been with me for so long..." she professes.

  Harry forces a smile and replies "I always will be."
  
  Cheryl closes her eyes and shakes her head in a final goodbye. The ice creeps
up over Harry, sealing him in her memories forever.




o+- Bearer of Guilt -+o

How To Get It:

  Build up as much Unfriendly PI as possible. Don't make attempts to be
friendly with anyone.


Major PI:

 - "False" to questions: 1 and 3
 - "Yes" to being a private person
 - "Yes" for taking a while to be understood
 - DO NOT have the bull as the most guilty
 - "No" to staying together for kids


Description:

  Harry stands before his daughter. He knows she can't forgive him. Nor does
he want to be forgiven.

  Cheryl stands up and confronts her guilt. "Why did you have to die?" she asks,
withholding her tears. "It wasn't my fault," she cries, "someone has to take the
blame." Harry approaches her with open arms to try and comfort her. 

  She stops him, holding his hand away from her. They both feel cold to each 
other.

  "Forget me." Harry whispers as he retracts away from his daughter. His body
freezes as he steps back. His eyes frozen upon Cheryl, he crumbles to the
floor...




o+- Hero Forever -+o

How To Get It:

  Build up any Fake PI that you can. Basically, you want to play off like you're
not interested in the doctor's help, just saying whatever you need to in order
to get through the therapy. Whenever you can, try to contradict yourself.
  
  
Major PI:

 - Look away from the doctor while he's talking; stare at the lamp
 - Answer "False" or "No" to every question asked except to confirm completion
 - Put all the sleeping/dead photos on one side (doesn't matter which)
 - Don't adjust the guilt line
 - Pair two gay couples
 - Put all the abstract images on the non-sexual side
 - Let Harry drown in the car, as well as on the way to the lighthouse
 
Description:

  "Dad..." Cheryl whispers. Harry kneels down before her. "You are a hero." She
smiles, happier with a father she loves than the truth. "The man who died ...
that wasn't my father." She pauses, taking a breath. Her eyes begin to water. 
"That isn't who I remember. Those memories are all I have. You're all I have."

  He turns from her. "I'm not even a ghost..." he whispers.

  Cheryl shakes her head, unable to bear losing him. She wraps her arms around
him tightly, tears streaming down her face. They hold each other closely. For
once, Cheryl feels warm...

| Videotape Ending | [V.2] |
+------------------+-------+

  This is the series of clips shown immediately after the Encounter Ending.
They're all presented as part of a home-made videotape. There are four
variations, which are titled as follows:

 - Love Lost
 - Sleaze and Sirens
 - Wicked and Weak
 - Drunk Dad
 
 
o+- Love Lost -+o

How To Get It:

  Same criteria as Broken. Build up as much Family and Friendly PI as 
possible. Act as a genuine family man; focused on what's important.
  
  
Major PI:

 - "True" to questions: 1, 3, 6, and 7
 - "False" to questions: 2 and 5
 - "No" to spending time with friends, over family
 - "Yes" to marriage can last
 - "No" to sex becoming stale
 - Avoid sexual and alcoholic PI
 

Description:

  Harry places his suitcase on the ground and turns to his wife. So many words
come to mind, but he says nothing. He just stares at the woman standing before
him.

  "You be careful?" Dahlia softly requests.
  
  "Sure." Harry nods lightly, not concerned about safety for the moment.
  
  "Harry..." Dahlia tries to explain. Harry holds up his hand.
  
  "We've said enough. Let's just..." he turns and notices Cheryl recording the
farewell. "Sweetie, don't film this." This is not a memory he wishes to keep. He
approaches Cheryl and kneels before her. "You know this has nothing to do with
you, right?" Dahlia crosses her arms and listens from the background.

  "Even though mom and dad don't love each other anymore, we both love you. And
we always will." He places his hand on top of the camera, "now come on." 

  Cheryl lowers the camera and turns it off.
  
  
  
  
  
  
o+- Sleaze and Sirens -+o

How To Get It:

  Gain as much Sexual PI as possible. This is easy, since all you have to do is
stare at every sexual thing you come across.
  
  
Major PI:

 - Get a good look at every sexual poster you find
 - Stare at women's chests/behinds while around them
 - "True" to question 5
 - "False" to questions: 3 and 7
 - "Yes" to preferring friends over family
 - "Yes" to being a slut
 - "No" to being a virgin
 - Include Sex Ed in classes of choice
 - Watch Lisa change
 - "No" to marriage really lasting
 - All abstract images classed as sexual
 

Description:

  "Action," Harry calls from the bed, "come on in girls. Introduce yourselves!"
  
  Michelle bows before the camera. "I'm Michelle and I'm Midwich High's prom 
queen." She turns and sits at Harry's side, wrapping her arm behind him.
  
  "And our next star..." Harry summons.
  
  Lisa giggles as she enter's the camera's view. "I'm Lisa; I'm a nurse."
  
  Lisa hurries over to Harry's other side. "And I'm Harry Mason; famous author
and seducer of prom queens and nurses."

  "Can we be in your next book?" Michelle innocently requests.
  
  "Sure." He complies.
  
  "Can you dedicate it to us?" Lisa asks, placing her hand on his chest.
  
  "Nope," Harry declines, "dedications are always to my wife and daughter. It's
only fair." They join each other in laughter before falling back on the bed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
o+- Wicked and Weak -+o

How To Get It:

  Gain lots of Unfriendly PI and act like you hate everything. Having the tan
coat outfit is a good indicator that you're on your way to this ending.
  
  
Major PI:

 - "False" to questions: 1 and 3
 - "Yes" to being a private person, and taking a while to be understood
 - "No" to preferring friends over family
 - "Yes" to being a bully and slacker
 - All sleeping photos on "Dead" side
 - Watch Lisa change - She'll be angry
 - Give Lisa the wrong pills
 - Place Celestine, the princess, as most guilty
 - All abstract images non-sexual
 

Description:

  Cheryl walks down the dark hall, playing with her video camera. She heads
towards her parents' bedroom to show them, when she realizes that they're
fighting. Again...

  "You piece of shit!" Dahlia screams at Harry, "When're you gonna bring in some
real money?" She slaps him.

  Harry raises his hand to his face. He says nothing. Nothing will satisfy this
demon of rage.

  "You think your crap is Shakespeare? Your piece of shit novels... no one even
reads them!" She strikes him again in fury. Harry collapses to the floor. He yet
remains silent.

  "Be a man!" Dahlia screams "Come on! Fight back!" Harry does nothing. Dahlia
towers over him, glaring down at the weak man before her. "You're pathetic... 
to think that I used to hang off your every word.... to this waste of space!" 
She strikes him again.

  Harry's glasses clack against the wooden floor. He bends over and picks them 
up, slowly returning them to his face. He notices Cheryl with her camera. For
a moment he looks at her, ashamed of himself. He remains silent.
  
  
  
  
  
  
o+- Drunk Dad -+o

How To Get It:

  Easy, just stare at any alcohol you find and answer the questions that
obviously are attributed to being an alcoholic. It doesn't take much 
Alcoholic PI to get this.

  By the time you get to the first encounter with Michelle, you've likely
already built enough Alcoholic PI to get the ending.

Major PI:

 - "True" to question 2
 - Stare at all the Alcoholic PI you find (there isn't much anyway)
 - "Yes" to being a drunk
 - Stare at the doctor's collection of booze
 

Description:

  It's late at night. Harry approaches the front porch, beer bottle in hand. 
    
  "The hell you filmin' me for? Am I supposed to dance for ya?" In a mockery, 
Harry waves his arms around and pretends to dance, before collapsing to the
porch floor in a drunken stupor. His beer spills on the ground.
  
  "Be a good girl for daddy and go get him another drink will ya?" Cheryl stares
at her fallen father. "Now! Get me a damn beer!" He demands. He sits up and
looks at the bottle in his hand. "No wonder I drink with a family like this."
    


+------------+-------+
| UFO Ending | [V.3] |
+------------+-------+

  This is the usual joke ending. In this case, you have to call a number
advertised on a billboard and then take photographs of UFOs all over the town.
If you miss even one, you forfeit the ending.

  This ending is only available on a New Game+, which is the same for the others
in the series, except for Homecoming and SH4 (which doesn't have a UFO ending
at all. As soon as you are able to use the phone (just after meeting Cybil) you
can call the phone number to get started. The number you need to call is
555-3825.

  Throughout the walkthrough section, I've noted each of the UFOs' location, but
here's a list of them anyway.

  
1 - III.1 Streets - Under a street light in the alley near the playground. It's 
big and obvious enough that you can't miss it.

2 - III.3 Forest Path - Through a hole in the fishing lodge roof

3 - III.3 Hunter's Cabin - On top of a barrel out back of the hunter's cabin

4 - III.5 Football Field - Between goal posts. Big. Can't miss it

5 - III.5 Cathouse - On roof, where you jump between the Cathouse and Wonderland

6 - III.5 Courtyard - In courtyard, above statue in the middle

7 - III.5 Hall to Gym - In a tree on the west side of the path; near the wall

8 - III.8 Nurse In Distress - On the road; look down on from the mall entrance

9 - III.9 family Pet - Inside a fish tank. Easy to spot with your light off

10 - III.9 Green Lion Pawn Shop - On top of a shelf in the pawn shop

11 - III.11 Sewer Access - Through some bars in the sewer. Just before the exit

12 - III.12 Docks - At the end of the dock to your left as you jump the fence.

13 - III.12 The Lighthouse - In the water off the northern coast from the
pier that the lighthouse is on.

+-----------+--------+
| Music Box | [VI.1] |
+-----------+--------+

  The message you receive from the echo in the same room is your hint to
solving the puzzle. The solution has always been the same for me, so I 
guess it's not actually critical to listen to the message or even get the
echo, but the static is annoying anyway.

  When you listen to the message, there will be a part that plays the tune.
The tune also has animal sounds associated with it, and the keyboard has
colors associated with it. So any of these instructions should help you:

Green - Pink - Yellow - Yellow - Blue
Duck - Owl - Parrot - Parrot - Chicken
Quack - Hoot - Squawk - Squawk - Cluck
A# - G - A - A - D (for those who are musically inclined)


+---------+--------+
| Shadows | [VI.2] |
+---------+--------+

Quick Solution: Call 555-8465

  The idea is to arrange the objects to create a phone number. Although 
the solution is always the same, to solve it, you want to pick up the 
two sculptures on the left and place them so their shadows vaguely form 
an 8. The next sculpture doesn't need to be moved, it's a 4. The next 
two swan sculptures, when placed together resemble a 6. Finally, turn 
the pipe and clamp as far as they go to the right. This forms a 5. This
forms the 7-digit phone number to call.
  
  
+-------------+--------+
| Planetarium | [VI.3] |
+-------------+--------+

Quick Solution: Call 555-2327

  Walk down the aisle to the right from the door. There's an echo coming 
from one of the seats. Listen to the message, it's an instructor who 
mentions the Little Bear (Ursa Minor) constellation. This is your hint 
that you need to look at this constellation.

  Go to the desk and hit the lower button to turn on the machine. Then go 
to the projector and rotate it until you find the right constellation. If 
you're not familiar with it, there's a picture on the wall you can check. 
The Ursa Minor constellation will also have the brightest star.

  Once you have Ursa Minor in your view, go back to the desk and press 
the upper button. It'll light up the constellations and also a message. 
The message says to call 555-2327. Once you do, the door to proceed 
will unlock.
  
+-------------+--------+
| Gym Keycode | [VI.4] |
+-------------+--------+

Quick Solution: The keycode is: 1031

  On the keypad next to the door is a number, 1053. Inside locker 1053
is a photo with the keycode on the backs of two football players. One
is 10 and the other is 31. This is the keycode.


+-------------+--------+
| PC Password | [VI.5] |
+-------------+--------+

  Even if you know the answer, you have to use the forgotten 
password tool. Click on the "forgotten password" link. This will
prompt you with three random questions of the following. The answers
are all found somewhere in the office.

**Note: The "-" button is a hotkey for backspace here.

Wasted three years of my life in order major in?
 - "Geology"
 - Diploma on wall behind computer desk
 
I said goodbye to bachelorhood, freedom and happiness, where?
 - "Hawaii"
 - Framed photo on shelf behind the computer desk
 
The greatest baseball team, without question?
 - "Shiners"
 - Hat on chair in front of desk
 
My only true (four-legged) friend?
 - "Nicky"
 - Collar hanging on the coat-hanger across from the computer
 
My star sign even though I don't believe any of that?
 - "Scorpio"
 - Astrology poster behind secretary's desk
 - Birthday posted on calendar near secretary's desk
 
The king of sports, a man's game of squash?
 - "Racquetball"
 - Trophy mounted on wall
 
My bitch of an ex-wife's name?
 - "Valerie"
 - Call number from post-it on secretary's computer (555-9433)
 
What is the name of my wayward, waste-of-space son?
 - "Otto"
 - Signed drawing on floor near computer desk
 
Probably the best Shakespeare comedy?
 - "Twelfth Night"
 - Book found in bookcase in corner of office, across from computer
 
 
 After you answer the questions, the password will be set to "sunday45" 
which you can now use to unlock the computer.


+----------------+--------+
| Bridge Control | [VI.6] |
+----------------+--------+

  Use the controls and read the following before hitting the red button. A 
light will come on and you need to pull the associated lever. The lights are 
as follows:

 - Green: Nothing; just wait a moment
 - Blue: Middle lever
 - Red: Left lever
 - Yellow: Right lever
 
  Once you've followed four correct sequences, the bridge will start to move.
  
+---------------+--------+
| Radio Request | [VI.7] |
+---------------+--------+

Quick Solution: 555-8814 for "Daddy's Girl"

  Zoom in on the radio (B) and grab the knob (B+A) and turn it to about 102. 
The DJ will loop, talking about calling in to request a song. The song you 
want to request is Daddy's Girl (4). So dial 555-8814.

  After calling, you just wait a moment for the song to come on and then the
ice on the door will melt away. You can han gup the phone as soon as your call
gets connected; you don't have to listen to the DJ recording on your phone.

+-----------------+--------+
| Gumball Machine | [VI.8] |
+-----------------+--------+

Quick Solution: Purple, pink, red, yellow

  As the voicemail vaguely suggests, the colors the girl likes are the colors
of the cartoon bird's beak. To change the color of the current gumball, grab
the sphere and shake it. You don't have to get the colors in any order, just
as long as you get each of them.

  The colors you want are: purple, pink, red, and yellow. Try not to mistake the
black for purple. This puzzle confuses everybody their first time, so don't
feel bad if you didn't catch on right away.


+------------------+--------+
| Celebration Time | [VI.9] |
+------------------+--------+

Quick Solution: The code is 2050

  Listen to the message. There will be two sound clips played. What
you have to do is find the cards in the store that play those sounds. 

  The first card is for a 20th anniversary. The second card is for a
50th birthday. Note the numbers: 20 and 50. Punch those in the keypad
and head through the door.
