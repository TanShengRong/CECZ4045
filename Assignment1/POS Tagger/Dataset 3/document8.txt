There are two Sin Hoi Sai 新海山 in Singapore – one at Tiong Bahru, and the other called “Sin Hoi Sai Eating House” at East Coast.The restaurant at East Coast is offering islandwide delivery, link here: https://sinhoisai.ezqr.sg/. Delivery charges are $6 within 6km, and $12 above 6km from the East Coast outlet (Postal code 428893).FREE delivery for locations within 3km, or with spending above $60 (within 6km) or $100 (above 6km).You can also call +65 6440 6956, operating hours will be from 12pm to 12am.According to a Straits Times article, Sin Hoi Sai is founded in 1978 by Madam Yap Sor Khim, while it expanded 3 years later to East Coast Road.She runs the operations at East Coast Road, while her younger brother Yap Seng Lye heads the kitchen. Her two sisters operate the Tiong Bahru branch, and her husband and son also help out in the family business. (Not sure if it is in the same arrangement now.)The outlet at Tiong Bahru is listed in the Singapore Michelin Guide with a Michelin Plate.Located in a residential area, Sin Hoi Sai is known for its spacious laid-back surroundings (they have al-fresco dining available) and Singaporean seafood dishes.  The offer a range of live seafood, from different types of fish to shellfish, and you can simply pick what you want from the aquarium tanks. Must-try is their famous Chili Crab and Black Pepper Crab, while other styles such as Deep-Fried Crab with Chinese Wine, Salted Egg Crab, Butter Crab, Black Bean Sauce Crab, and Spring Onion & Ginger Crab are available ($90 for delivery).Local zi char dishes are also available.In terms of specialties, they include Deep-Fried Prawn Rolls ($8), Deep-Fried Yam Ring ($15), Crab Meat Omelette ($8), Chilli Snails aka Chut Chut ($8), Omelette with Reserved Radish ($6), Sambal Crayfish ($25) and Stir-Fried Lala Clams with Garlic. Their Prawn Paste Chicken ($8), Guinness Pork Ribs ($10), and their special Indonesian Chicken ($10) are also popular specials. Long-time patrons often order their Cereal Prawns ($15), Hotplate Deer Venison ($15) and Hotplate Tofu ($8).The one dish I would often order there is the Pig Trotters Bee Hoon ($10), because it is a dish that is getting harder to find, and Sin Hoi Sai makes a rather house-style and much saucier version than the usual.Sin Hoi Sai – Tiong Bahru
