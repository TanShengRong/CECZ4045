ABSTRACT
Networks of simple analog processors having neuron-like properties have
been employed to compute good solutions to a variety of optimization problems. This paper presents a neural-net solution to a resource allocation problem that arises in providing local access to the backbone of a wide-area communication network. The problem is described in terms of an energy function
that can be mapped onto an analog computational network. Simulation results
characterizing the performance of the neural computation are also presented.
INTRODUCTION
This paper presents a neural-network solution to a resource allocation
problem that arises in providing access to the backbone of a communication
network. 1 In the field of operations research, this problem was first known as
the warehouse location problem and heuristics for finding feasible, suboptimal
solutions have been developed previously.2. 3 More recently it has been known
as the multifacility location problem4 and as the concentrator assignment problem.1
THE HOPFIELD NEURAL NETWORK MODEL
The general structure of the Hopfield neural network model5 ? 6,7 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Neurons are modeled as amplifiers that have a sigmoid input!
output curve as shown in Fig. 2. Synapses are modeled by permitting the output of any neuron to be connected to the input of any other neuron. The
strength of the synapse is modeled by a resistive connection between the output
of a neuron and the input to another. The amplifiers provide integrative analog
summation of the currents that result from the connections to other neurons as
well as connection to external inputs. To model both excitatory and inhibitory
synaptic links, each amplifier provides both a normal output V and an inverted
output V. The normal outputs range between 0 and 1 while the inverting amplifier produces corresponding values between 0 and -1. The synaptic link between the output of one amplifier and the input of another is defined by a
conductance Tij which connects one of the outputs of amplifier j to the input of
amplifier i. In the Hopfield model, the connection between neurons i and j is
made with a resistor having a value Rij = 1rrij . To provide an excitatory synaptic connection (positive Tij ), the resistor is connected to the normal output of

amplifier j. To provide an inhibitory connection (negative Tij), the resistor is
connected to the inverted output of amplifier j. The connections among the
neurons are defined by a matrix T consisting of the conductances T ij . Hopfield has shown that a symmetric T matrix (Tij = Tji ) whose diagonal entries
are all zeros, causes convergence to a stable state in which the output of each
amplifier is either 0 or 1. Additionally, when the amplifiers are operated in the
high-gain mode, the stable states of a network of n neurons correspond to the
local minima of the quantity

where Vi is the output of the ith neuron and Ii is the externally supplied input

THE CONCENTRATOR ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM
Consider a collection of n sites that are to be connected to m concentrators as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The sites are indicated by the shaded circles
and the concentrators are indicated by squares. The problem is to find an
assignment of sites to concentrators that minimizes the total cost of the assignment and does not exceed the capacity of any concentrator. The constraints
that must be met can be summarized as follows:
a) Each site i ( i
and

= 1,

2, ... , n ) is connected to exactly one concentrator;

777

b) Each concentrator j (j = 1, 2, ... , m ) is connected to no more than kj
sites (where kj is the capacity of concentrator D.
Figure 3(b) illustrates a possible solution to the problem represented in Fig.
3(a).

where Xij = 1 only if we actually decide to assign site i to concentrator j and is 0

satisfy constraint a). Exhaustive search techniques are therefore impractical
except for relatively small values of m and n.
THE NEURAL NETWORK SOLUTION
This problem is amenable to solution using the Hopfield neural network
model. The Hopfield model is used to represent a matrix of possible assignments of sites to concentrators as illustrated in Fig. 4. Each square corresponds

to a neuron and a neuron in row i and column j of the upper n rows of the
array represents the hypothesis that site i should be connected to concentrator
j. If the neuron in row i and column j is on, then site i should be assigned to
concentrator j; if it is off, site i should not be assigned to concentrator j.
The neurons in the lower sub-array, indicated as "SLACK", are used to
implement individual concentrator capacity constraints. The number of slack
neurons in a column should equal the capacity (expressed as the number sites
which can be accommodated) of the corresponding concentrator. While it is
not necessary to assume that the concentrators have equal capacities, it was
assumed here that they did and that their cumulative capacity is greater than or
equal to the number of sites.
To ena~le the neurons in the network illustrated above to compute solutions to the concentrator problem, the network must realize an energy function
in which the lowest energy states correspond to the least cost assignments. The
energy function must therefore favor states which satisfy constraints a) and b)
above as well as states that correspond to a minimum cost assignment. The
energy function is implemented in terms of connection strengths between neurons. The following section details the construction of an appropriate energy
function.

where Y ij is the output of the amplifier in row i and column j of the neuron
matrix, m and n are the number of concentrators and the number of sites
respectively, and kj is the capacity of concentrator j.
The first term will be minimum when the sum of the outputs in each row
of neurons associated with a site equals one. Notice that this term influences
only those rows of neurons which correspond to sites; no term is used to coerce
the rows of slack neurons into a particular state.
The second term of the equation will be minimum when the sum of the
outputs in each column equals the capacity kj of the corresponding concentrator. The presence of the kj slack neurons in each column allows this term to
enforce the concentrator capacity restrictions. The effect of this term upon the
upper sub-array of neurons (those which correspond to site assignments) is
that no more than kj sites will be assigned to concentrator j. The number of
neurons to be turned on in column j is kj ; consequently, the number of neurons turned on in column j of the assignment sub-array will be less than or
equal to kj .
The third term causes the energy function to favor the "zero" and "one"
states of the individual neurons by being minimum when all neurons are in one
or the other of these states. This term influences all neurons in the network.
In summary, the first term enforces constraint a) and the second term
enforces constraint b) above. The third term guarantees that a choice is actually made; it assures that each neuron in the matrix will assume a final state
near zero or one corresponding to the Xij term of the cost equation (Eq. 2).

After some algebraic re-arrangement, Eq. 3 can be written in the form of
Eq. 1 where
.,
{A * 8(i,k) * (1-8U,I) + B * 8U,1) * (1-8(i,k?, if i<n and k<n
T IJ kl =
(4)
,
C * 8U,I) * (1-8(i,k?, if i>n or k>n.
Here quadruple subscripts are used for the entries in the matrix T. Each entry
indicates the strength of the connection between the neuron in row i and column j and the neuron in row k and column I of the neuron matrix. The function delta is given by

0, otherwise.
The A and B terms specify inhibitions within a row or a column of the upper
sub-array and the C term provides the column inhibitions required for the
neurons in the sub-array of slack neurons.
8( i , j ) = {

Equation 3 specifies the form of a solution but it does not include a term
that will cause the network to favor minimum cost assignments. To complete
the formulation, the following term is added to each Tij,kl:

D ? 8( j , I ) ? ( 1 - 8( i , k ) )
(cost [ i , j ] + cost [ k , I ])
where cost[ i , j ] is the cost of assigning site i to concentrator j. The effect of
this term is to reduce the inhibitions among the neurons that correspond to low
cost assignments. The sum of the costs of assigning both site i to concentrator j
and site k to concentrator I was used in order to maintain the symmetry of T.
The external input currents were derived from the energy equation (Eq.3)

This exemplifies a teChnique for combining external input currents which arise
from combinations of certain basic types of constraints.
AN EXAMPLE

The neural network solution for a concentrator assignment problem consisting of twelve sites and five concentrators was simulated. All sites and concentrators were located within the unit square on a randomly generated map.
For this problem, it was assumed that no more than three sites could be
assigned to a concentrator. The assignment cost matrix and a typical assignment resulting from the simulation are shown in Fig. 5. It is interesting to
notice that the network proposed an assignment which made no use of concentrator 2.
Because the capacity of each concentrator kj was assumed to be three
sites, the external input current for each neuron in the upper sub-array was
I ij = 6
while in the sub-array of slack neurons it was
I ij = 5.
The other parameter values used in the simulation were
A = B = C =-2

and

D = 0.1 .

Since this choice of parameters results in a T matrix that is symmetric
and whose diagonal entries are all zeros, the network will converge to the
minima of Eq. 3. Furthermore, inclusion of the term which is weighted by the
parameter D causes the network to favor minimum cost assignments.
To evaluate the performance of the simulated network, an exhaustive
search of all solutions to the problem was conducted using a backtracking algorithm. A frequency distribution of the solution costs associated with the assignments generated by the exhaustive search is shown in Fig. 6. For comparison,
a histogram of the results of one hundred consecutive runs of the neural-net
simulation is shown in Fig. 7. Although the neural-net simulation did not find
a global minimum, ninety-two of the one hundred assignments which it did
find were among the best 0.01 % of all solutions and the remaining eight were
among the best 0.3%.
CONCLUSION
Neural networks can be used to find good, though not necessarily optimal, solutions to combinatorial optimization problems like the concentrator

assignment problem. In order to use a neural network to solve such problems,
it is necessary to be able to represent a solution to the problem as a state of the
network. Here the concentrator assignment problem was successfully mapped
onto a Hopfield network by associating each neuron with the hypothesis that a
given site should be assigned to a particular concentrator. An energy function
was constructed to determine the connections that were needed and the resulting neural network was simulated.
While the neural network solution to the concentrator assignment problem did not find a globally minimum cost assignment, it very effectively rejected poor solutions. The network was even able to suggest assignments which
would allow concentrators to be removed from the communication network.
