Welcome to my Silent Hill Homecoming guide, fellow survival horror fan.
- Berserker
===============================================================================

     W H E R E ' S   M Y   S Q U A D?   D I D   T H E Y   M A K E   I T?

Sounds of sirens and explosions fill his mind as he is pulled through a dark 
hallway by a hospital team.  Scenes of death are all around him as he is taken 
toward a room then suddenly... silence.  He struggles to break free from his 
hospital straps as he hears the sounds of slaughter in the hall outside of his 
room.  After freeing himself, his brother Joshua comes into view behind a gate 
in a hallway further down the outside corridor.  He opens the gate to meet up 
with his little brother but Josh runs from him.  He follows him but Josh 
continues to keep away from his older brother.  The surrounding hospital enters 
a hellish state and horrifying creatures begin to appear as he attempts to 
catch up to his little brother.  During one final attempt to meet up with Josh, 
he is overcome by a sudden sense of guilt as Josh stares at him as if 
frightened while backing away then fleeing from him.  A calm lapping of water 
from a room near the end of the hall only intensifies this sudden feeling of 
guilt as he walks toward the elevator around the corner and takes it to the 
basement.  Shortly after the elevator stops, a big knife suddenly plunges 
through the elevator door on a course directly toward his neck then-

              O N L Y   A N O T H E R   N I G H T M A R E . . .

Alex Shepherd awakens in the passenger's seat of a truck shortly before the 
trucker drops him off in his hometown of Shepherd's Glen.  Alex has finally 
returned home from the service.  The constant troubling nightmares involving 
his younger brother have caused him to return to his hometown to check on his 
family.  The once lively Shepherd's Glen is now deserted and a heavy fog has 
enshrouded the town through which mysterious figures can be seen.  Waiting for 
him at home is a near empty house.  His catatonic mother can only speak in 
short sentences as she tells him about the disappearance of his brother, Josh, 
and Alex's father.  "I miss your brother, Alex..." 

                      E V E R Y O N E ' S   G O N E.

And that is where our story begins as we take on the role of Alex Shepherd as 
he sets out to learn exactly what went wrong with his hometown of Shepherd's 
Glen and find his little brother, Josh.  Alex tells his mother...

                        I ' L L   F I N D   H I M.

******
SAVING
******

Find glowing red circle designs with three smaller circles in the middle along 
walls and examine them in order to save your game.  Don't always keep one save 
file, it is best to make a least two save files!

*******
JOURNAL
*******

The Journal menu can be accessed through the pause menu by pressing start.  
Clues, tutorials, pictures and child's drawings found throughout the game will 
be recorded or added to the Journal as they are found.  A notebook icon will 
appear on the upper right hand portion of the screen whenever extra information 
is added to the journal.

***
MAP
***

If the map of the current area has been obtained, then it can be viewed by 
tapping the Y button during gameplay.  Push in on the right stick (RS) to zoom 
in on the map and use the right stick to navigate the map.

The map will be updated based on what Alex has found in a room or if a room is 
locked or impassable.  Scribbles denote an impassable door or section while 
keys and other various symbols showcase important doors and areas.  It is very 
important to inspect everything so that Alex makes note of it on the map.  This 
will greatly help out in locating certain areas that have already been passed.
 
**********
OBJECTIVES
**********

Objectives may be viewed by pulling up the map with the Y button and tapping 
the X button.  Much like with journal info, a notebook icon will appear on the 
upper right hand portion of the screen whenever an objective is updated or a 
new objective is added.

************
WEAPON WHEEL
************

Tap the RB button to bring up the weapon wheel.  You can also press and hold 
the RB button to view the wheel then let go to make it disappear.

Use the left thumbstick to highlight various weapons then tap the A button to 
equip the currently selected weapon or exit the screen and the highlighted 
weapon will be automatically equipped.  Press the B button to cancel the menu 
and tap RS to inspect a weapon.  The flashlight and radio can be turned on by 
tapping the X and Y button respectively once they have been obtained.  The 
flashlight can also be turned on during gameplay by tapping D-pad (Directional 
Pad) down.  Weapons may be cycled through during gameplay by tapping either to 
the right or left on the D-pad.

***************
INVENTORY WHEEL
***************

Tap the LB button to bring up the inventory wheel.  You can also press and hold 
the LB button to view the wheel then let go to make it disappear.

Use the left thumbstick to highlight various important items then tap the A 
button to use the currently selected item or exit the screen and the 
highlighted item will be automatically used.  Press the B button to cancel the 
menu and tap RS to inspect an item.  A Health Drink and First Aid Kit can be 
used by tapping the X and Y buttons respectively once they have been obtained.

********************
FLASHLIGHT AND RADIO
********************

Turn on the flashlight by pressing up on the D-pad or by entering the Weapon 
Wheel menu and tapping X.  The flashlight will allow Alex to see in dark areas 
but it will also catch the attention of enemies.  Nurses are the main enemies 
that react to light, so always keep the light off when they are in the area.  
Other enemies are slightly phased by light from a distance, but they are not 
near as reactive as a Nurse

Note: Alex turns his flashlight off automatically following some cutscenes, so 
if it is suddenly dark for you, then make sure that Alex's flashlight is on.

Turn on the Radio by entering the Weapon menu and tapping the Y button.  Nearby 
enemies will cause the radio to produce a static noise, so this can be used to 
tell when an enemy is in the area.  Order members are the only enemies that the 
radio will not pick up since they are living human beings.  The radio should 
stay on at all times.  There is no reason to turn it off.

******
HEALTH
******

Alex's life bar is displayed as the red gauge on the left side of the screen.  
This gauge can be extended by collecting and using any of the 8 serum items 
found in the game.

Whenever Alex is hit, damage will be sustained depending on the enemy attack 
that hit him.  To heal Alex, open the Inventory Wheel menu and tap the X button 
to use a Health Drink or the Y button to use a First Aid Kit if Alex has any at 
that time and this will heal his life gauge.  A serum will fully restore all of 
Alex's health gauge as well as increase it a bit.

Here's a chart to show the effectiveness of each health item on Alex's health 
bar:

o----------------------------------o
| HEALING ITEM  | HEALTH REPLENISH |
|==================================|
| Health Drink  | Slight           |
| First Aid Kit | Moderate         |
| Serum         | Full + Extend    |
o----------------------------------o

TIP: If you save your game with a limping (low health) Alex and get killed off 
then reload the prior save with low health, Alex will have a bit of his health 
restored when he starts and he will not be limping anymore.  This can help you 
to save some valuable health items.

*************************
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTION
*************************

Press the A button near an object to interact with it or view a description of 
the object if one is available.  It is very important to interact with just 
about every object around the environment.

Sometimes different commands will appear while standing next to an object, such 
as "Examine", "Investigate", "Use" among many others, so be sure to watch for 
these commands while standing next to objects.

*************
OPENING DOORS
*************

Tap the A button while standing near a door to quietly open it.  Double tap the 
A button while standing near a door to burst through it.

Doors can be opened by prying with a steel pipe at time and there are sometimes 
other obstacles such as boards in the way of a door that Alex will need to hack 
through in order to open one.  As usual, some doors can only be opened with a 
key.

***************
USING KEY ITEMS
***************

After inspecting some areas, button icons will appear on the bottom of the 
screen to denote that a key item may be used in that area.  This is usually the 
case for locked doors.  To use an item on an object hold the LB button to bring 
up the inventory wheel then highlight the object to be used and tap the A 
button to use it.

********************
BUTTON TAP SEQUENCES
********************

Every now and then, Alex will enter a short cutscene where a button must be 
tapped in order to continue or escape from an on-screen attack.  A random on-
screen button will appear, so prepare to mash whatever button is displayed to 
finish the sequence successfully.

*************
DIALOGUE MENU
*************

As a brand new feature in Silent Hill, a player can now take control of the way 
a conversation will play out by choosing between choices that appear on the 
screen during some cutscenes.  The choices may be chosen by pressing the button 
icon that appears next to the choice.  Some of these choices will affect the 
ending to the game but most of them simply allow the player to experience extra 
dialogue.  Usually the conversations that affect the story are fairly obvious.

******
COMBAT
******

=====================
Combat Stance/Lock-on
=====================

While a weapon is equipped, hold the LT button to assume a combat stance and 
lock-on to the closest enemy.  Alex's flashlight will highlight the closest 
enemy.  To switch targets, tap the right stick in the direction of the desired 
enemy to be targeted.

=======
Weapons
=======

Hold down or press RB to bring up the Weapon Wheel menu then choose a weapon to 
equip by moving the left stick to highlight a weapon then select it with the A 
button.

============
Fast Attacks
============

Tap the A button while a weapon is equipped and while in combat stance to 
perform a fast attack.  Fast attacks are very quick and a combination of fast 
attacks, maybe leading into a strong attack, can be performed after a single A 
button tap.  Fast attacks will not stun enemies or knock them down like a 
strong attack will.

==============
Strong Attacks
==============

Tap the X button while a weapon is equipped and while in combat stance to 
perform a strong attack.  Strong attacks are slower than fast attacks and can 
only be used to end a combination of fast attacks when performed in a combo.  
These attacks do more damage but they also leave Alex open to other attacks 
after they are performed thanks to the long startup and ending animations.  All 
strong attacks may be charged except for when they are performed as a counter 
hit from a dodge or roll.

===========
Combination
===========

As already mentioned above, fast attacks can be combined into combo attacks and 
strong attacks can be used to end a combination of fast attacks.

=======
Gunplay
=======

While a gun is equipped, enter combat stance and press RT to fire, X to reload, 
and A to perform a melee attacks with the gun.  Guns are most important for 
hitting Smog enemies but they can work well for other enemies such as Schisms, 
Ferals and Siams as well.  Always remember to stand at a distance from the 
enemy while using a gun.  Alex cannot dodge to the side while a gun is 
equipped, he can only roll to the side.  Still, rolls can be used to move away 
from an enemy for a good distance to fire.

=======
Dodging
=======

Press the B button to perform a dodge.  Dodges are best used while in combat 
stance with a melee weapon equipped.  Time the dodge press to the moment right 
before an enemy attack connects to make Alex perform a dodging animation that 
may position him behind or to the side of an enemy, giving him the advantage 
for a follow-up attack.  You can also press forward, backward, to the right or 
to the left to dodge in the corresponding direction.  A direction does not have 
to be held most of the time in order to dodge enemy attacks.  Counter attacks 
can be performed out of any dodge.  Press the X or A button right after a dodge 
while a melee weapon is equipped to perform a counter attack with your melee 
weapon.

===============
Evasive Rolling
===============

Press in any direction then tap the B button to perform an evasive roll.  
Rolling is much like dodging but a roll is not always guaranteed to evade an 
enemy attack.  Alex can be knocked out of rolls unlike a successful dodge right 
before an enemy attack.  Even though they are not guaranteed, Alex will travel 
a further distance away from the enemy with a roll when compared to a dodge, so 
rolls come in handy for quickly distancing Alex from his foes, especially when 
shooting an enemy.  Just like with the dodge, a counter attack may be performed 
by tapping the X or A button while holding LT right after a roll.

============================
Quick Recover from Knockdown
============================

Press the B button as soon as Alex hits the ground when falling from an enemy 
attack to recover immediately.  Time your button press to the appearance of the 
dust below Alex when he lands.

=========
Grappling
=========

If an enemy ever grapples Alex with an attack, quickly mash the button that 
appears on the screen to escape from the grapple.  Some grapple will 
automatically kill Alex if they are not escaped from.  Try not escaping from a 
Schism grapple to see what I refer to - it's not pretty.

=========
Finishers
=========

Once an enemy has been dazed through constant strong attacks or counter attacks 
with a melee weapon, walk up to it and press the X button with a melee weapon 
equipped to perform a finisher.  Finishers differ in animation depending on the 
current melee weapon that is equipped.  Some enemies are much harder to get 
into this dazed state than others.  Smog enemies are some of the toughest since 
guns work better against them.  Lurkers and Swarms do not have finisher 
sequences, but they can still be smashed up a bit with normal attacks.

==================
Melee Combat Moves
==================

The following is a list of all the moves associated with each weapon in the 
game.

([ ] = press and hold button)

------------------------------
Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger
------------------------------

The knife or dagger is really the best melee weapon in the game.  It is the 
quickest weapon and has an extremely fantastic A, A, A, X combination that 
leaves enemies little time to retaliate with an attack of their own.  A charged 
X slash is good for knocking down normal enemies as well.  Using the charged X 
slash in the middle of a combo usually works well for knocking down enemies - 
the sudden charge in between slashes confuses them and they usually allow it to 
hit them.

--> Normal Attacks

 A - Slash to left

[X] - Forward Stab

--> Combination Attacks

 A - Slash to left____
          |           \
 A - Slash to right___ [X] - Downward slash to right
          |           \
 A - Downward slash    [X] - Upward slash
          |
[X] - Spinning slash to right

--> Counter Attacks

(all performed out of a roll or dodge)

Dodge Back - Overhead slash
Dodge Right - Slash to left
Dodge Left - Slash to right
Dodge Forward - Upward slash

------------------
Steel Pipe/Crowbar
------------------

The pipe or crowbar has an average recovery and damage rate.  Its charged X 
swing is very useful for normal enemies both while they are standing or 
grounded.

--> Normal Attacks

 A - Swing to left

[X] - Homerun swing to left

--> Combination attacks

 A - Swing to left___
          |          \
 A - Swing to right   [X] - Upward swing to right
          |
[X] - Overhead swing

--> Counter Attacks

(all performed out of a roll or dodge)

Dodge Back - Quick Overhead swing
Dodge Right - Swing to left
Dodge Left - Swing to right
Dodge Forward - Upward swing

--------------------
Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe
--------------------

The axe weapon is the slowest normal weapon but it packs some big power.  The X 
swing is very powerful but it leaves Alex open to attack both during and after 
the swing.

--> Normal Attacks

 A - Chop to left

[X] - Overhead chop

--> Combination Attacks

 A - Chop to left___
          |         \
 A - Chop to right  [X] - Chop to right
          |
[X] - Jumping overhead chop

--> Counter Attacks

(all performed out of a roll or dodge)

Dodge Back - Quick overhead chop
Dodge Right - Chop to left
Dodge Left - Chop to right
Dodge Forward - Upward chop

----------------------------
Circular Saw (secret weapon)
----------------------------

The saw is a very slow yet a extremely powerful weapon and it has an instant 
kill move.  Charge the X button when standing near an enemy for an incredibly 
pleasing stab forward with the saw.  This move can kill many normal enemies 
instantly.

--> Normal Attacks

 A - Swing to left

[X] - Forward saw step (must be charged)

-------------------------------------
Mk. 23 Handgun/'Chrome Hammer' Pistol
-------------------------------------

The handgun is not very powerful but it is the best ranged firearm that Alex 
can get early in the game.  The ammo capacity is probably its best aspect.  
This weapon works best for Smog enemies and distant Ferals.  Distant Nurses are 
sometimes good to use it on as well.

--> Melee Attack

A - Overhead swing/Pistol whip

Ammo Pickup: 9 (normal), 5 (hard)     | Ammo Pickup: 12 (normal), 7 (hard)

---------------------------
Shotgun/'Bluesteel' Shotgun
---------------------------

As expected, the shotgun packs quite a punch from close range but it can be 
hard to find ammo for this weapon.  It is best to save ammunition for Schisms 
or bosses instead of using this on other enemies.

--> Melee Attack

A - Handle Ram or Handle Swing to left

Ammo Pickup: 4 (normal), 3 (hard)     | Ammo Pickup: 5 (normal), 4(hard)

---------------------------------------
M14 Assault Rifle/Police Marksman Rifle
---------------------------------------

The rifle takes some good damage from both close and long range.  It doesn't 
deal as much damage as the shotgun, but it fires more rapidly and it works 
better from a distance.  This weapon works really well for Siams since it will 
damage them faster than a handgun and it will make them pause after each hit 
unlike the shotgun.

----------------------------
Laser Pistol (secret weapon)
----------------------------

If it moves then shoot it with a few blasts from this alien weapon and it will 
become motionless soon, guaranteed.  This weapon nearly knocks any normal enemy 
down with the first blast then Alex can continues to pump laser blasts into 
that enemy while it is grounded.  It defeats bosses with only a few hits.  
Needlers can block the laser blast just like any other gun blasts though.  Be 
sure to spam the hell out of them with the infinite ammo that this weapon comes 
with and... well, let's just see how long they can continue to block with those 
blade arms.

This section is jam-packed with everything you will need to survive this 
nightmare and collect all the serums, photos and child's drawings throughout 
the various areas along the way.

Here's a few other things you should know about this walkthrough:

- Key items and weapons will be surrounded with "++", normal items will be 
  surrounded with "--", save points will be surrounded with "!!" and all file 
  locations are CAPITALIZED.  Files may not be collected in this installment of 
  Silent Hill.
- Some rooms will have "(OW)" beside them which stands for Otherworld - in 
  other words, Alex will be in Otherworld while in that particular room.
- Boss sections have boss attacks listed.  Read the description of the boss 
  attack to learn the animation and then read the boss strategy to figure out 
  how to avoid it.
===============================================================================

___________________________ _ ALCHEMILLA HOSPITAL _ ___________________________

Objective:

[ ] Escape from the hospital.

== Operation Theatre ==

What in god's name is attacking the doctor in the hallway outside!  GOT TO GET 
FREE!  Tap the A button to struggle out of the straps.

Note: You can stay in the straps for as long as you like and nothing will 
happen.

A tutorial dealing with your weapon menu will appear.  Tap the RB button to 
pull up the weapon menu.  Tap the X button while the menu is up to turn on your 
flashlight.  Press the B button to cancel the menu.  You can also press and 
hold the RB and cycle through your menu then simply let go of the RB button 
when you're done - this is my preferred method.

Take a moment to look around the room and get the feel of the controls.  The 
left analog moves the main character while the right analog moves your camera. 
Tap the A button to interact with the environment.  I know your simply dying to 
examine that bloody sink.  You might want to take a look at the DOCTOR'S MEMO 
to the left of the double doors before exiting out into the hallway.

In Silent Hill Homecoming, our young war veteran doesn't have to simply open 
the door with the slight tap of the A button when the button icon appears, oh 
no, he can bust right through the door with a ram by double tapping the A 
button when the icon is showcased.  He's got a bit of Meester Scott Kennedy 
flare there.

So, what is our main character's name?  His name is Alex Shepherd.

== Operating Room ==

Would you look at that blood trail just begging to be followed?  Open the door 
that it leads to.
 
== Hallway Outside Operating Room ==

To your left is a gate with some sort of shadowy figure behind it lying on the 
ground.  Directly ahead are two doors. Examine the MISSING PATIENT'S BULLETIN 
on the right bulletin board.  Walk over to the gate.  It seems that the figure 
is actually Josh, Alex's little brother.  Alex doesn't have the correct 
combination for the keypad to the right of the gate just yet, so enter the door 
next to the keypad - the other door is locked.

== Nurse Center ==

Examine the board full of x-ray's and take note of the middle x-ray.  It seems 
the numbers "624" are scratched onto the bottom of the x-ray.  Examine the 
ATTENTION STAFF note along the right counter as you walk over to the ++MAP OF 
THE HOSPITAL++ on the bulletin board in the back of the room.  Collect the map 
then open the door to the left of it.  We'll have to return to Josh later.  Y 
opens your map screen, X displays your objective while the map is up, RS zooms 
in and out of the map and B cancels the map screen.

== Hallway South of Nurse Center ==

Let's see, room 201 is jammed, room 202 is blocked.  Room 203 has a baby cry 
coming from inside.  Bingo!  Enter Room 203.

== Room 203 ==

Examine the middle baby incubator.  It seems a child left its burnt doll 
inside.  The baby cry will stop after examining the doll.  Pick up the --HEALTH 
DRINK-- from the counter and examine the PAGE FROM AN INCIDENT REPORT right 
beside it.  Walk over to the hole in the wall to get a "Hop Over" command.  Hop 
into the Room 204.

== Room 204 ==

Examine the BASIC WEAPON COMBAT note on the middle table.  Examining this will 
add the MANUAL to your journal.  Walk over to the flickering x-ray board on the 
south side of the room and examine the x-ray on it.  Pick up the ++X-RAY FILM++ 
from the board.  In order to leave, you'll need to hop back through the opening 
in the wall then exit room 203 and step back out into the hall.

== Hallway South of Nurse Center ==

Run back to the Nurse Center and step back inside.  It seems that Josh is still 
right outside the room... drawing.  Walk over to the x-ray board and pull up 
your inventory menu by tapping LB.  Use the left analog to select the X-ray 
Film that you got from Room 204 then press A to place it up on the board.  The 
number sequence "624872" is now shown on the two x-rays.  This number will also 
be added to your journal under "Clues" as will all clues and hidden codes 
throughout the rest of the game.  Step back out into the Hallway Outside of 
Operating Room.

== Hallway Outside of Operating Room ==

++ KEYPAD PUZZLE 1 ++

Walk over to the key panel and enter the following code:

** 624872 **

The door will unlock.  Oh, don't worry Alex, it's just your creepy little 
brother... open the door already!

Well, that didn't go so well... the little bastard.  Walk over to the drawing 
on the floor and collect the --CHILD'S DRAWING (1/18)--.  This will be added to 
the "Drawings" section of Alex's journal.

Objective Update:

[ ] Follow Joshua

Now let's talk about opening doors.  The only door that can be opened is the 
door to the Male's Restroom that Josh slipped off into.  Open the door and 
enter the Men's Restroom.

== Men's Restroom ==

Josh will run away from Alex once again when Alex enter this room.  Walk over 
to the mirror and touch the mirror to go to Otherworl... uh, wrong game there, 
Travis.

Anyway, you'll notice a strange crumbling noise once Alex steps into the 
restroom.  Open the first stall for a gruesome sight.  Stall 2 seems to be 
empty.  Open the door on the opposite enter of the room while continuing to 
follow little bro.

== Storage ==

Directly ahead of Alex is one of the game's many save points.  The red circle 
with the three smaller red circles will always be your save point for Silent 
Hill Homecoming.  Examine the !!SAVE POINT!! and save your game.  Make sure 
that you keep multiple saves throughout this game just in case.  It seems that 
Josh crept off to the Women's Restroom.  How amusing.  Open the door to the 
restroom on the other side of the storage room.

== Women's Restroom ==

Alright, let's check the stalls.  Stall 1 is locked.  Stall 2 has nothing in 
it.  Stall 3 has nothing in it either.  Oh, well.  Take the ++COMBAT KNIFE++ 
stuck in the middle of the mirror above the sinks.  A cutscene will play 
directly after Alex takes the knife.

== Women's Restroom ==

Oho, real-time Otherworld changes, how nice!  Oh yeah, here comes the creepy 
movie Nurse also!

Before I get into the specifics of attacking her, there is one thing that you 
should see for yourself.  Turn off your flashlight and run past the Nurse.  
Keep moving from one side of the room to the other and eventually she will stop 
and stand still if you don't run or turn on your light.  Nurses can only track 
Alex based on sound and light.  Always remember to turn the light off when you 
see a Nurse in a room and you just might be able to get the drop on her or 
completely avoid her.  Even a Nurse that has spotted Alex can be fooled into 
stopping if you stay away from her long enough.

Hold the LT button to target the nurse as she steps toward Alex then tap the X 
button for a strong attack or the A button for a light attack.  The combo A, A, 
A is as far as the light attacks can go in terms of combination.  You can 
insert an X attack into the combo to end a light attack combination - this can 
be used for a four hit A, A, A, X combo.  Strong attacks can be charged for 
greater damage at any time, even during a combo.  Alex can also dodge to the 
side or duck while holding LT by pressing to either side along with B or simply 
tapping B.  This will allow him to escape from enemy attacks.  While not 
holding LT, Alex can roll in whatever direction you are holding.

Combo A, A, A, X seems to work very well for a Nurse, so spam her with the 
combo to knock her out.  If you play around with the fact that she does not 
respond to light or sound, you can easily sneak up to her and perform a charged 
heavy attack to knock her down then you can stab her while she lies on the 
ground.  A finishing move can be performed when an enemy is stunned - a Nurse 
will fall to her knees at that time.  Simply rush up to the stunned enemy then 
hold the LT button and tap X to finish off the enemy with a finishing blow.  
Don't worry too much about learning to dodge the Nurse's attacks yet - you 
don't really need to learn how to dodge a Nurse's attacks in order to fight 
her.  Defeat her to bag your first achievement.

Achievement unlocked:

-> Alchemilla's Finest (10G)

Walk over to the stall that the Nurse moved out of and choose to "Squeeze 
Through" the narrow hole in the back of the stall when the command appears.

== Men's Restroom (OW) ==

I hope that is just a tree root around the wall up ahead.  Open the door to the 
closest stall to find another tree root.  Collect the --FIRST AID KIT-- hanging 
on the wall to the left of the west door.  Exit the room and step out into the 
hall.

== Hallway Outside Restrooms (OW) ==

The only open door is the door to the south staircase, so open it and continue 
to the stairs.

== South Staircase (OW) ==

Ah, the damn out of control wheelchairs!  Examine the PATIENT NOTE on the 
window.  The staircase to the first floor is sealed off by those horrid looking 
roots, so let us continue to floor three.  It's amazing how disturbing a simple 
fan can look in Otherworld.  Static will begin to sound from Alex's radio as he 
reaches the top.  Turn off your flashlight via the RB menu then walk over to 
the glass window and choose to "Break" it then "Hop Over" into the next room.

TIP: If you use LT to target before hopping into the Day Room then you can see 
where one of your attackers is positioned.

== Day Room (OW) ==

Be sure to enter this room with your light turned off!  A Nurse is mesmerized 
by the light that the TV is giving off up ahead, so walk up to her and attack 
from behind.  Perform a charged X press to knock her down then run toward her 
and stab her with X taps while she is on the floor.  If she ever leans over 
then move up to her and press the X button while targeting her to deliver a 
finishing blow.  Another Nurse will join in on the fight (she is standing near 
the dark wall to the right of the TV), so try to finish off the first Nurse 
fast.

There is a mutilated body over on the sofa - nothing that uncommon in 
Otherworld though.  Yawn.  Walk over to the narrow section of the wall that 
stands out from the rest and tap the A button when the "Cut" command appears.  
Alex will drive his blade into the skin wall, so help him out by tapping the A 
button to slice downward and create an opening to room 203.  Choose to "Squeeze 
Through" to the next room.

== Room 303 (OW) ==

A !!SAVE POINT!! is directly ahead, so save your game.  Examine the NOTE on the 
bed.  Open the door to the right and step out into the Hallway South of Linen 
Room.

== Hallway South of Linen Room (OW) ==

The door on the west side of the hall is locked.  Move down the east side of 
the hall.  A strange crackling noise can be heard as Alex makes his way to the 
hospital bed in the middle of the hall.  Prepare for a cutscene.  Sit down 
whatever it may be that you are eating since a Swarm of bugs will be right in 
front of Alex as the cutscene ends.

In order to defeat the Swarm, you can equip the knife then hold LT and tap the 
A button to stomp them while they are on the ground or you can wait for them to 
fly in front of Alex then hit them with the combat knife or lastly you can wait 
until one of them latches onto Alex then tap the B button to make Alex grab it. 
Once Alex grabs one of them, a button icon will appear - either A, X or B.  Tap 
the corresponding button to have Alex toss the bug to the floor and kill it.  
You will get an achievement after defeating this Swarm.

Open the door to the Linen Room.

== Linen Room (OW) ==

Pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the shelf off to the left.  There is nothing 
else in here, despite the dead body, so exit out to the Hallway Outside 
Operating Room.

== Hallway Outside Operating Room (OW) ==

Run to the south side of the hallway.  Take the --PHOTO (1/11)-- from the 
hospital gurney at the south end of the hall.  Collecting this will give you an 
achievement.  Open the door at the north end of the hall.

-----
Achievement unlocked:

-> Sightseeing (10G)

== Operation Theatre Balcony (OW) ==

Examine the PATIENT'S CHART on the shelf to the right while moving along the 
top floor.  Run to the far end of the balcony then step down the stairs to the 
right since the iron lung and other objects will block Alex's way.  Move along 
the right side of the walkway then turn off your flashlight and choose to "Drop 
Down" once Alex reaches the portion without railing at the end.

Note: If you look off the side without railing, you can see Nurses lying in 
ambush below around the middle bed.

== Operation Theatre (OW) ==

Be sure that Alex has his flashlight off at this point.  The static on the 
radio will give you an idea or what is near the operating table.  Turn around 
to see a Nurse standing near it.  There are a total of three Nurses around the 
east side of the operating table - the table has a half of a  patient on it.  
Should you choose to fight the Nurses, be sure to use a charged strong attack 
to start things off.  Remember that you can lure them around the room and make 
them stop if Alex stands still with the light off.

Be careful about moving around too much while the Nurses are still in the room 
since the slightest bump against an object will make move toward that 
direction.  Examine the double doors to the Operating Room to find that they 
are chained shut.  Turn to the east side of the room then cut the skin wall 
with Alex's combat knife and squeeze through the opening.

== East Staircase (OW) ==

The sound of steam spewing from nearby pipes will flood the room as Alex steps 
into this area.  At first, it sounds a lot like someone dragging a giant blade, 
but it isn't him... thank god.  Directly across from the skin wall that Alex 
squeezes through is another --CHILD'S DRAWING (2/18)-- on the wall, so be sure 
to pick it up.

Move up the stairs.  Approach the body on the gurney at the top of the stairs 
then examine it.  The other half of the patient from the Operating Theatre is 
on the gurney.  Take the ++OPERATING THEATRE KEY++ from his hand.  Move back 
down the stairs then squeeze back through the wall again.

== Operating Theatre (OW) ==

Approach the chained doors to the Operating Room and press the LB button when 
the icon appears.  Use the left analog to select the Operating Room Key then 
tap A to use it on the chain and unlock the doors.  Open either door and step 
inside.

== Operating Room (OW) ==

Examine the ELECTROSHOCK NOTE on the counter along the right side of the room. 
Open the door to the hallway.

== Hallway Outside Operating Room (OW) ==

A cutscene will play.  These type of cutscenes give you control over the 
cutscene dialogue.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Joshua's Toy

It doesn't matter how Alex responds to Josh since you'll have to perform the 
same task - find him his bunny.  This conversations also doesn't affect the 
ending either.  Open the door to the left of the gate after the cutscene.

== Nurse Center (OW) ==

Take the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the shelf across from the door then save your 
game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the x-ray board against the right wall.  Examine 
the MISSING PATIENT BULLETIN along the left side of the controls by the window. 
Step out into the hallway via the door on the south side.

== Hallway South of Nurse Center (OW) ==

The only door that can be opened is the door to Room 203, so you know what to 
do.

== Room 203 (OW) ==

A cutscene will play as Alex steps into the room.  Something else beyond that 
hole in the glass likes Robbie the rabbit also!  Walk toward the bloody mirror 
and examine it.  Reach inside.  Keep tapping the button that appears to break 
free from the thing's grip and Alex will pry the ++ROBBIE TOY++ away from 
whatever is on the other side of the mirror.

Objective Update:

[ ] Return the toy to Joshua.

A Swarm will fly out of the back of the middle baby incubator in the room after 
snatching the Robbie toy away from the mirror, so be prepared to squash them.  
Pick up the --CHILD'S DRAWING (3/18)-- from off the wall on the right side of 
the mirror before leaving the room.

== Hallway South of Nurse Center (OW) ==

Return to the Hallway Outside Operating Room by going through the east end of 
the Nurse Center.  Save your game along the way.

== Hallway Outside Operating Room (OW) ==

Walk over to the gate where Josh is and open the inventory menu then select the 
Robbie Toy and attempt to give it to him by tapping A.  A cutscene will play.

Walk through the open gate after the cutscene and pick up the --CHILD'S DRAWING 
(4/18)--.  Most of the doors down the hall area are locked.  The door to Room 
206 is wide open however.  Sounds of a metal object being dragged across the 
metal floor can be heard coming from Room 206.  The door to Room 206 will shut 
as soon as Alex walks up to it.  Move over to the Room 206 door and take the 
--CHILD'S DRAWING (5/18)-- from the front of it.

The sound of lapping water from a shore can be heard coming from Room 206.  
Just what the hell is in there anyway?  No matter, the door is locked, so just 
continue down the hall.  Approach the elevator up ahead then press the elevator 
call button on the left wall to trigger a cutscene.

Note: If you are low in health, do not heal.  During the transition to the next 
area, Alex's life gauge will be fully recovered.  This is the only area of the 
game where Alex's health recovers between areas, so take advantage of it, 
especially if you're playing on hard mode.

                                                                         [WT02]
________________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ _______________________

If you didn't recognize the trucker in the cutscene then that was Travis Grady. 
If you don't know who Travis Grady is then go play Silent Hill Origins right 
now and learn of his story with the dreaded town, one of my favorites.  ...and 
if you get stuck then you could always look up Berserker's walkthrough for 
Origins.

All plugs aside, welcome to Shepherd's Glen!  You'll be treated to a foggy town 
that appears very similar to the streets of Silent Hill after the cutscene 
where Alex arrives in his hometown.  Just like before, tap the Y button to 
bring up Alex's map - the map is VERY important in these town areas.  Fans of 
Silent Hill should know that all too well.

If you try to go back the way the truck came then, you can't.  The fog is too 
thick and it will lead Alex right back to the same area.  A "?" will be labeled 
on your map in that area.  You can check the double doors to the building on 
the south side to get Dr. Fitch's building marked on your map.  Move down the 
street to the east and a cutscene will play in front of the Town Hall.

Objective Update:

[ ] I need to go home.

After the cutscene, you might want to walk to the south section of Craven 
Avenue.  It's interesting how the road ends so suddenly like a road in Silent 
Hill, isn't it?  Notice how the tree roots in the courtyard of the church 
overlap the sidewalk much like the constant flesh-like tree roots spotted in 
the Alchemilla Hospital dream sequence - interesting.  Open the doors to the 
Town Hall.


________________________________ _ TOWN HALL _ ________________________________

Move through the double doors directly ahead and take the --PHOTO (2/11)-- from 
off the counter to the left of the podium inside the middle room.  The HISTORY 
OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN book can be examined from the bookstand behind the podium.  
If you examine the back of the podium, there is a keyhole in the cross insignia 
on the podium.  This will be used much, much later.  If you read over the 
History of Shepherd's Glen then you will note that the town had four founding 
families.  The families ancestors are all depicted on the paintings on the 
middle sidewalls of this room... except there are only three paintings...?

If you go through the left door in this room then you'll get to see a boarded 
up door in the north hall - you don't have a weapon to chop through the board 
just yet.  Exit out into the right hallway.  Find the door to the right after 
exiting out of the middle room and open it then enter that room.

Examine the NEWSPAPER ARTICLE on the wall to the left as soon as Alex enters.  
Walk to the back table on the left and examine the medical case to receive your 
first --SERUM (1/8)-- pickup.  Serums will slightly boost Alex's health when 
used.  They will also refill his life bar to max.  Make the most out of these 
Serums by using them when Alex is low in life!  You will gain an achievement 
for finding this Serum.

Exit the room and step back out into the hallway.  Turn to the left and move 
down the hall.  Open the first door down the left hall and step into the room.

save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the wall across from the fireplace.  
Exit the Town Hall and step back out into the street.

________________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ _______________________

Move to the north along Craven Avenue and head for the Shepherd House (Alex's 
House) as marked very obviously on his map.  A cutscene will take over to the 
north and you will be placed right outside of the Shepherd House.  There is a 
hole in the brick wall next to the garage door of the Shepherd House that can 
be ducked under to enter the park nearby.  It is kind of useless to go there 
now since you'll need to go there in just a few minutes after gaining an item 
inside of the house that will allow Alex access to an area behind it.  Further 
north along the outside road, it will come to an abrupt end like the opposite 
end of the street further to the south. Enter the Shepherd House through the 
front door.


_____________________________ _ SHEPHERD HOUSE _ ______________________________

Objective Update

[ ] Explore the house.

Both doors on the bottom floor are locked and the living room doesn't have 
anything special inside.  You might want to view the surrounding objects to 
read about Alex's thoughts on each one - some of them are quite interesting, 
like the picture without him in it.

Move up the stairs.  You'll find another interesting picture at the top of the 
stairs - why is Alex never in the photos?  Enter the double door room off to 
the right.  Examine the LETTER FROM MOM TO DAD on the left desk.  There is 
another photo on the right cabinet.  Enter the restroom to the side of the bed 
and pick up the --CASETTE TAPE-- from the counter off to the left inside.  Exit 
the room.

The slightly open the door down the hall will shut as Alex walks toward it.  
Oh, the hell with that door then, let's open the one on the left side of the 
hall.  Well get to that feisty door later.

Pick up the ++FLASHLIGHT++ from off the lower bed and a cutscene will play.

If you've already played through the game one time and received the UFO ending 
and saved your game afterwards, then pick up the ++LASER PISTOL++ from off the 
trunk next to the beds.  You'll receive an achievement for picking this up.

You can examine the BUG COLLECTION on the side of the wall.  Be sure to examine 
the bookshelf.  A puzzle will appear as you investigate it.

++ BOOKCASE PUZZLE ++

Highlight the books with the right analog then use the left analog to slide all 
the books over to the left.  This will reveal a yellow switch on the right side 
of the shelf.  Press the switch to make the bookshelf open to reveal hidden 
room.  Take the ++MAP OF OUR HOUSE++ from off the wooden shelf inside.  The 
door on the side of this room is locked, so exit the room and step back out 
into the hall.

Walk over to the door that swung shut earlier at the end of this hall.  As you 
can see, it is locked, so you must go back downstairs.  A cutscene will trigger 
as Alex begins to move down the stairs.  Wow, what a family this man has got.  
A creepy younger brother and a mother that wreaks of death.  Alex will receive 
the ++OLD REVOLVER++ after this cutscene, though it is never acknowledged that 
he received it - check your inventory to see it.  Let's check out the basement, 
shall we?

Objective Update:

[ ] Investigate the basement.

You can't do anything with the light switch, so move down the stairs of the 
basement.  The basement is flooded and a cutscene will play once Alex steps 
into the water at the bottom.  A Lurker will attack immediately after the 
cutscene, so take out the knife and prepare to slash him with an A, A, A, X 
combo to bring an end to his days of lurking in the submerged portions of 
people's basement.  Whenever you fight a Lurker, it is best to run to the side 
of him and allow him to lunge and miss his lunge then simply run up to him and 
attack while he recovers.  You'll get an achievement after finishing him off.

Watch out for the other Lurkers in the back of the basement!  I'm only 
kidding... or am I?

SPECIAL NOTE: Don't cut the sheet on the side of the wall yet!  If you look 
through the cloth sheet along the wall across from the staircase with Alex's 
flashlight turned off, you can see a figure on the other side of the sheet.  
Push in on RS while standing near the sheet to see him more clearly.  This is 
an image of Alex's father with his back turned.  If you cut through the sheet, 
then the figure turns out to be a mannequin.  Up until now, if this is your 
first playthrough then this is your first glimpse of Alex's father.  Keep in 
mind that you don't have to cut through the sheet right now if you want to - I 
mention cutting it in the walkthrough mainly for story purposes.  You'll have 
to cut the cloth sheet later in the story for sure though.

Find the thin sheet on the side of the wall then equip the knife and use the 
command to cut through while close to it.  Squeeze through the narrow opening. 
Examine the door along the left wall for a cutscene.  The door is locked, so 
simply leave this section of the basement.

Walk to the back of the basement and pick up the ++GARAGE REMOTE++ from the top 
of the water pump in the back.  A note is left up under the remote.

Objective Update:

[ ] Drain the water in the basement.

The nearby door to the backyard will not open as long as the basement is 
flooded and the safety latch for the door is somewhere below the door submerged 
in water.  You'll have to get some gas from the garage and bring it back to the 
water pump in this basement.

Exit the basement by going back up the stairs.  Walk back outside of the house 
and use the garage remote on the garage.  

Objective Update:

[ ] Find some gas to power the pump.

A Lurker will move out of the garage door as it opens so get ready to slash 
him.  Pick up the ++STEEL PIPE++ from off the shelf in the garage then arm it 
and use it to pry open the door on the glowing cabinet at the end of the 
garage.  Tap the A button to pry it open.  Pick up the ++EMPTY GAS CAN++ from 
inside.  Examine the COMBAT TRAINING MANUAL off to the right of the garage.

Objective Update:

[ ] Look for a way to fill the gas can.

If this is your second playthrough then be sure to pick up the ++CIRCULAR SAW++ 
from the left table in the back of the garage.  You'll receive an achievement 
for collecting it.

As you leave the garage, a Lurker will crawl through the hole along the side of 
the brick wall and attack.  Defeat him with a A, A, X combo from the steel 
pipe.  The Steel Pipe is really the best weapon to use against a Lurker since 
an X hit will easily smash its head.  Right after an A, A, X combo, charge an X 
attack to immediately smash its head if the hit connects.  Walk over to the 
hole in the brick wall and choose to "Duck Under" it to reach the other side.  
Duck up under the next hole in the brick wall further ahead.


__________________________________ _ PARK _ ___________________________________

An eerie child phrase will come from the park off to the side.  Pick up the 
--CHILD'S DRAWING (6/18)-- hanging on the wall to the right.  On the south end 
of the park there is slide with a --PHOTO (3/11)-- lying on the ground near it. 
Walk over to the fence on the south end of the park and pry it open while your 
Steel Pipe is equipped.

Note: The child phrase that is heard when Alex first enters the Park is random. 
It is always a different phrase from the children's song, "Ring Around the 
Rosie".

A Lurker will attack from behind some trashcans in the alley off to the left.  
Walk down the alley after defeating him and use the Empty Gas Can on the side 
of the truck when the button icon appears to get some gas from the truck and 
receive the ++FULL GAS CAN++.  You can climb up the ladder in the middle of the 
alley, but there is nothing there.  Go back to the Shepherd House and enter the 
house again.  You might want to go back to the Town Hall and save, but if you 
do, you'll run into Lurkers out on the street.  They crawl out of the gutters.

Walk back down into the basement.  Move to the back of the flooded basement and 
use the Full Gas Can on the water pump.  The water pump will start after the 
cutscene.  Examine the door to the right and Alex will pull on the safety latch 
at the bottom of the door and unlock it.  Open the door to continue.

== Backyard ==

A doghouse without a dog.  Oh dear.  If you move further into the backyard, 
you'll eventually hear some dog noises like a dog is running toward Alex.  On 
the right side of the backyard, check the very end of the first garden row to 
find a --HEALTH DRINK-- hidden below a plant.  Take the --CHILD'S DRAWING 
(7/18)-- from the left side of the fence further ahead then examine the 
backpack against he back gate to obtain a --PHOTO (4/11)--.  Before stepping 
through the gate, enter the back door on the porch and step back into the 
Shepherd House.

== Kitchen ==

Use the cassette tape on the tape player/answering machine on the left counter 
after stepping inside to listen to the tape.  Open the refrigerator on the 
right side of the kitchen and collect the --HEALTH DRINK-- from inside.  Walk 
over to the door further ahead and open it.  Examine the NOTE TO ADAM on the 
small table to the left and you can also examine the sewing machine on the 
desk.  Exit the house via the back door then step out through the back gate of 
the backyard.

                                                                         [WT03]
__________________________ _ ROSE HEIGHTS CEMETERY _ __________________________

Objective Update:

[ ] Joshua isn't at home.  Search the rest of the town.

[ ] Search the graveyard and nearby section of the town for information on 
Joshua's disappearance.

[ ] Find someone who knows something about fixing guns.

The right path is cut off by a sudden hole, so move down the left path.  Step 
onto the walkway behind the open gate.  The gate at the end is locked, so move 
down the stairs to the left.

== Old Crypts ==

Take the ++ROSE HEIGHTS CEMETARY MAP++ from the bench further ahead.  The 
sounds of a snarling dog can be heard as Alex continues ahead.  Move through 
the doorway ahead.  You can examine the coffins inside.  Step through the next 
doorway.

You can examine the coffins in the next area as well.  Step into the hall ahead 
then step through the next crypt.  You'll eventually exit to the East Garden.

== East Garden ==

Alex will notice a man digging up graves behind the gates off to his left.  
Stay in the middle and walk toward the ledge off to the side to get a "Climb 
Down" command.  Do so to trigger a cutscene.

A Feral (dog) will attack after the cutscene.  Ferals are easiest to defeat 
with the Combat Knife since Alex can hit them very quickly to counter just 
about any attack that they might do.  Use the A, A, A, X combo on it a few 
times to finish it off.  You sometimes need to dodge in between combos since 
the Feral's attacks are so fast.  Ferals can be finished immediately after a 
knockdown with a strong attack by approaching them and tapping X while locked 
on.  You'll get an achievement after finishing off the Feral.

Walk toward the damaged fountain up ahead and pick up the ++OLD STONE PLATE++ 
from the pedestal after reading the inscription.  Move over to the ledge that 
the creepy tree shadow rests against and use the command to climb upwards.  
Wouldn't you know that the gate that leads to the Bartlett Mausoleum is locked! 
Pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the middle bench under the metal gazebo.

Walk down the narrow tunnel to the west that leads to the Family Crypts North 
corridor.

== Family Crypts North ==

The gates along the side of this area are all padlocked.  Walk against the open 
gate ahead to push it open.  In the second portion of the corridor, you can 
open the first gate off to the right, second gate off to the right and second 
gate off to the left.  The second gate off to the right has a !!SAVE POINT!! on 
the wall inside while the others only have coffins that can be examined.

In the next corridor, you can enter all the gates except for the second one to 
the right - this one is boarded up and you can't chop through the wooden boards 
yet with your current weapon.  Walk through the second gate on the left and 
you'll notice a narrow opening in the wall ahead.  Squeeze through the narrow 
opening and step into the Family Crypts Mid.

== Family Crypts Mid ==

Enter the second crypt to the left and pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from off 
the floor.  The crypt directly across from the current one has a hole in its 
east wall (left as Alex enters).  Enter the crypt and duck under the wall to 
enter the crypt on the other side of it.  Exit the crypt then push through the 
iron gate to the east.

All the crypts except for the first one to the left are open.  Enter the second 
crypt to the right and squeeze through the narrow opening in the wall.

== Founder's Row ==

Move to the south.  Once Alex walks up to the gate off to the left a Feral will 
attack from the section behind the tombs to the right.  Silence him with your 
combat knife A, A, A, X combo.  It's just like that other stupid dog, this 
one's got it comin' too!

You can jump in the pit behind the first gate to the left but a grate blocks 
the small opening on both sides of it.  Follow the path further south then jump 
into the second pit behind the gate to the left and duck under the opening.  
May the bugs lead the way!  Walk over to the right grate then choose to climb 
up to the next area.

== Founder's Garden ==

There is a --HEALTH DRINK-- beside a family gravesite on the far north end of 
this garden.  There is a Feral chowing down on a body in the middle of the 
garden - if you move around the left side, you can sneak up on him from behind 
him and clobber it with your trusty pipe (charge swing).  Knock it down with a 
charged swing from either weapon then immediately run to it and perform a 
finisher by tapping X while locked on and standing above it.  Either way, find 
your way down to the middle area - move down the stairs or step down through 
one of the portions without railing.  The two mausoleums are locked, so find 
the gate on the bottom north side of the garden then push it open.

== West Garden ==

Move up either set of stairs and you'll come upon an engraving at the top of 
each one.  The engravings talks about the stone plate that Alex has.


The Guardian that once was whole
Reveals the way that is shut
Two Halves on Twins Enshrined
Forever Split in Waters Divine

Once whole but now split in twain
Opens the way for souls to leave
Find the plates and release their pain
Once separate but now whole again.


The graveyard on the west side of this area is unlocked, but there is nothing 
inside.  Pick up the ++STRANGE STONE PIECE++ after reading the inscription on 
the pedestal of the fountain.  Walk along the path to the north.

The gate at the end is locked and it has a circular indention for something to 
be placed on.  Hmmm, and we just happen to have two circular plates halves that 
combine as one.  They both seem to have half of a tree image on them.  Say, 
this reminds me of that engraving that talked of a Guardian that was whole but 
split into.  It said to combine its two halves to release its pain... 

Aha!  Pull up the inventory menu while standing in front of the gate and place 
each circular plate half onto the gate.  It will unlock and open for Alex.

== Front Entrance ==

Move on ahead, up the stairs and enter the parking lot.

== Parking Lot ==

Run to the east side of the Parking Lot to exit back out onto Main Street in 
Shepherd's Glen.


________________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ _______________________

The east side of the street to the west ends at a gap, so head west along Main 
Street.  A van will come into view soon.  Another van blocks the alleyway 
behind the group of shops to the left side.  More vehicles block the left side 
of police department courtyard.

Walk toward the S.G.P.D building via the middle path then turn left at the 
building entrance and pick up the --FIRST AID KIT-- from off the ground at the 
end.  If you move down the right side of the front of the building you'll find 
a dead Feral.  It seems that Alex is not the only one killing animals in 
Shepherd's Glen today.  The front of the police department building is locked, 
so run back through the courtyard and continue to follow the Main Street to the 
west.  A cutscene will play as Alex approaches the woman posting up papers on 
the missing person billboard.

Alex will receive the ++WALKIE TALKIE++ after the cutscene.  The walkie talkie 
is your radio for this game.  You can talk to Elle after the cutscene, but she 
doesn't say much.  Move behind the missing person billboard and find the --
CHILD'S DRAWING (8/18)-- hanging on the back side of it.

The bridge that leads to the Bartlett Vineyards is destroyed and the street to 
the north ends at a gap.  Stay on the south portion of River View Road and move 
to the south.  The fog gets incredibly deep if you move too far to the south 
past the building off to the west much like the fog in the west on Main Street 
when Alex first entered Shepherd's Glen.

Take the path to the west and follow it to the bridge.  Run across the bridge 
then open the gate door past it to the left.


_________________________________ _ JUNKYARD _ ________________________________

== Outside Curtis' Shop ==

You can look past the junk in the west to see the light in front of the door to 
Curtis' Shop.  Duck under the opening to the north along the side of the wooden 
fence.

Move beyond the fences with gasoline barrels.  You can examine the water tank 
directly ahead for some slight memories from Alex.  You can step into Curtis' 
Shop via the back entrance but there is nothing inside and the door in there is 
locked.  Continue around the side of the building.  Enter the small wooden shed 
then squeeze through the narrow opening inside.  Move past the blue truck and 
you'll emerge on the other side of the Curtis' Shop next to the light.  Enter 
the building by opening the front door.

Alex will enter an interactive cutscene.

Alex will receive the ++MK 23 HANDGUN++ after the cutscene with Curtis.  Let's 
go over the basics of firearms.  Equip a firearm through the Weapon menu just 
like a melee weapon.  Use LT to enter precision mode where you can walk while 
holding the weapon and use the right analog to aim.  Press RT to fire, X to 
reload and A for a melee attack all while in precision mode.  All firearms have 
some sort of melee attack. The pistol whip with the Mk 23 Handgun greatly 
amuses me - that's one hell of a hit with the butt of a handgun!  Too bad the 
hit is so weak though.

You can talk to Curtis once again for another interactive cutscene.  You might 
want to save your game in the room behind him if you want to hear all choices.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Mayor Bartlett.  He was digging graves in the cemetery.

Move behind Curtis and check the BASIC RANGED COMBAT manual.  The information 
will be added to the "Manual" section of Alex's journal.  You'll want to grab 
the --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from the wooden table behind Curtis as well.  Walk 
through the doorway behind Curtis and pick up the ++JUNKYARD MAP++ from the 
nearby washing machine and the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the damaged refrigerator. 
There is some more --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- on the red stove.  Save your game at 
the !!SAVE POINT!! on the wooden door before opening the door to the west room. 
Alex will emerge in the back room that he could enter from the backyard 
earlier.  Exit the junkyard by stepping out the north entrance.

A Feral will attack from the south as Alex steps toward the entrance gate.  The 
handgun can work well for a Feral if your aim is good.  A well-timed shot will 
knock it down during mid-lunge.  I would still recommend using the Combat Knife 
for a safer disposal method.  The Combat Knife pins it down too easily unlike 
the handgun.


________________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ _______________________

Run across the bridge and a cutscene will play at the end.  A Smog monster will 
attack directly after the cutscene.  Don't use your Steel Pipe or Combat Knife 
here.  Take out the handgun and keep your distance from the Smog creature.  Its 
weak point is its orange glowing lungs in its chest.  Wait for it to open its 
chest to shoot out poisonous gas then shoot it right in the lungs.  If you can 
shoot it twice in the lungs then it will die.  These things can be deadly from 
close range, so keep your distance.  Tap the corresponding button that appears 
if Alex ever gets hit with its poison gas.  You'll receive an achievement after 
defeating it.

You still can't go south, so take River View Road north.  Make a right onto 
Main Street and follow it back to the east.  A Feral will attack in front of 
the police station.  Find the --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from the behind the left 
side of billboard next to the police station entrance.  Move down the middle 
path that leads to the police station (S.G.P.D) and pick up the --PISTOL 
AMMUNTION-- from the left side of the building - same place where you found a 
First Aid Kit earlier.  Take Main Street all the way to the east and enter the 
parking lot of Rose Heights Cemetery once again.


___________________________ _ ROSE HEIGHTS CEMETERY _ _________________________

== Parking Lot ==

A Feral is walking around in this area, so be prepared to defeat him.  Go 
through the Front Entrance and step into the West Garden once again.

== West Garden ==

Move down either staircase behind the walls to the south and enter the Founders 
Garden.

== Founders Garden ==

A Smog is loose in this area so prepare to blast him in the lungs with your 
handgun when he catches sight of Alex.  There is some --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- up 
the stairs along the northeast side (near the railing).  Hop into the pit on 
the far southeast side of the Founders Garden then duck under the opening to 
the left in the pit and climb up to the Founders Row area.

== Founders Row ==

Push through the gate.  Prepare to fight off the Feral as it busts through the 
gate further to the north.  Squeeze through the opening in the wall near the 
Family Crypts Mid area.

== Family Crypts Mid ==

Step out of the crypt and out onto the path then follow it west.  Ready your 
gun and aim for the lungs then shoot the Smog past the iron gate.  Enter the 
crypt on the left and duck back up under the opening in the wall to the right. 
Walk outside of the crypt then enter the second crypt on the right and squeeze 
through the opening in the north wall.  You'll emerge in the  Family Crypts 
North once again.

== Family Crypts North ==

Step out of the crypt and go through the iron gate to the east.  Enter the 
first crypt off to the left and save your game at the save point.  Push through 
the next iron gate and reenter the East Garden.

== East Garden ==

The Bartlett Mausoleum gate is now open!  Run to the east and enter the 
Mausoleum courtyard.  Open the door to the Bartlett Mausoleum.

== Bartlett Mausoleum ==

Examine the coffin directly ahead.  The coffin has a sliding block puzzle on it 
that needs to be solved.

Objective Update:

[ ] Open the lock to the casket inside the Bartlett Mausoleum.

++ SLIDING PUZZLE 1 ++

If you're like me then you probably gave the sliding puzzle an evil eye upon 
first glance - I dislike them greatly.  This one is not that bad though.  The 
main goal is to slide the top piece with the pin downward four times.  All you 
have to do is work the two long pieces over to one side then slide the top 
piece downward.  Use the right analog to highlight each piece and use the left 
analog to move the chosen piece.

The directions below start with the default setup of the blocks on normal mode 
and walk you through the way to move each block.  Really you could just go by 
the pictures.

__________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ _________________________

Welcome to the place where all begins... the town of Silent Hill.  About damn 
time Alex made his way here too.  You can backtrack a bit and check the famous 
road sign if you'd like.  Now we need to chase after Cheryl... I mean Josh.

Objective Update:

[ ] Catch up to Joshua.

Alex will gain the ++BROKEN WATCH++ item upon starting in Silent Hill.  Look 
over to the far left and find the gate that is locked.  You'll need to come 
back here once you find the key later - keep this gate in mind.  The gate is to 
the side of the hotel further along the street.  If you keep moving down the 
left side of the street, you'll come to the entrance of the Grand Hotel 
entrance.  The entrance is boarded up and Josh is huddled on the floor of the 
hotel on the other side of the boards.  You'll need to find some sort of weapon 
that will hack through these boards.  The street will end halfway down.  Look 
to the right side of the street and find the alleyway next to the building with 
the snapped power lines in front of it.

A Smog will move out from the corner of the alleyway, so take out your handgun 
and wait for him to expose his lungs then blast him.  Follow the alley and 
climb down to the lower ledge at the end.  Turn around and follow the trail 
that extends below the street.  Duck under the truck and collect the ++FIRE 
AXE++ from the other side... the side with the mutilated torso lying next to 
the truck.

Go ahead and equip the Fire Axe.  You might want to spend a little time getting 
used to its swings.  Go back the way you came and climb back up to the 
alleyway.  Return to the Grand Hotel entrance and interact with the wooden 
board blockade to hack through it.  Tap the A button to perform each chop.  
Open the double doors ahead.

                                                                         [WT04]
________________________________ _ GRAND HOTEL _ ______________________________

== Front Lobby ==

Damn this hotel is dark.  Move down the hall ahead then turn right at the dark 
corridor and walk down it.  Make another right and find the --HEALTH DRINK-- in 
the glass case along the wall.  Return to the main corridor.  You can check the 
doors along the way down the hallway if you want but they all seem to be locked 
for now.

A dark silhouette will be standing in the middle of the end of the corridor.  
This dark figure will run to the left as Alex calls out for Josh.  Josh will 
run even deeper into the hotel (past the debris that blocks the stairway) as 
Alex steps into the lobby.  What the hell is it with this kid?  I say we give 
him a good spanking with a jagged wood piece once we finally catch up to him.

Examine the NOTE TO PAUL on the front counter then collect the ++GRAND HOTEL 
MAP++ from the mail boxes in the back of the counter and you might want to 
examine the GENERAL NOTICE further to the left on the back counter.  The double 
doors are locked and the stairs are blocked off by rubble, so let's go through 
the open elevator shaft.  Use the action command to hop across the gap in the 
elevator shaft.  Pick up the ++MAINTENANCE KEY++ from the large toolbox off to 
the right.  The door on the other side is jammed shut, so hop back across the 
gap in the elevator shaft.

A Smog will move down the hall toward the lobby so equip the gun and deal with 
him by shooting those glowing lungs as he takes a potshot at Alex.  You need to 
leave the hotel via the front doors.


__________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ _________________________

Another Smog will be standing out in the street to the right.  Defeat him like 
all the others then walk over to the gate on the west side of the Grand Hotel.  
Use the Maintenance Key on the gate to unlock it.

Take the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the space in front of the left window.  Examine 
the power box on the right side of wall.

++ FUSE PUZZLE 1 ++

You need to rewire the cables so that the hotel can receive power.  Use the 
left analog to select each cable connector on the top then press A to select 
the connector.  The row of connectors at the bottom will light up when you 
press A once, so move the left analog and it will move the cord.  Press the A 
button again to place the cord. The goal here is to reroute the power so that 
the lights on the left side of the power box all light up after pressing X to 
turn on the power.  This can be done through a bit of trial and error.

Connect the cables as follows.

W = White, Y = Yellow, B = Blue, R = Red, G = Green

Y  W  R  B  G
 \/    \/   |
 /\    /\   |
W  Y  B  R  G

Here is a different diagram of the same puzzle that might help you better 
understand it just in case.  A later fuse puzzle will displayed like the one 
below, so I'm trying to get you familiar with it here.

Y  W  R  B  G
O  O  O  O  O

O  O  O  O  O
W  Y  B  R  G

The five circles to the left side of the cables on the power box will all light 
up after connecting the cables correctly to route the power appropriately.

Objective Update:

[ ] Power has been restored.  Use the elevator.

Now that the power to the hotel is on, enter the Grand Hotel once again.


________________________________ _ GRAND HOTEL _ ______________________________

== Front Lobby ==

Hmmm, still nearly dark as a dungeon up in here.  Run straight ahead and make 
your way back to the elevator.  Push the button on the right side of the 
elevator doorway to call it to the first floor.  Step inside and pick up the 
--PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from the right side of the elevator.  Walk over to the 
controls and interact with them.  It seems that the fifth floor is your only 
option, so let's go to floor 5!  Arm your handgun.

A cutscene will play as the elevator rises.  Don't set that controller down 
just yet, buddy.  A Needler will cut through the elevator wall on the left side 
(right side facing the doors) and attack from that side of the elevator as the 
elevator stops.  Equip the and aim for its head then shoot to knock it off.  It 
seems that you can really hit them anywhere on their body to knock them off but 
their weak point is the head.  If you don't have any shots left then use the 
Fire Axe but be warned that you will most likely get hit.

Achievement unlocked:

-> To The Point (10G)

Defeated 1 Needler
-----

Note: You do not have to wait until the Needlers cut open the elevator frame 
along the sides, Alex can shoot them right through the grating if the cursor is 
red while aiming at one.

There is absolutely little time to celebrate over your 10 gamerpoints, however, 
because another Needler will cut through the metal and attack from the opposite 
side.  Shoot it in its head and it will fall to its death.  The elevator will 
continue upward and all will be well with the world once again.

Well, ok, not really.  Shortly after the elevator stops, a Needler will grab 
onto the back of the elevator and cut through the metal.  Equip the handgun and 
blast him to send him back down the shaft with his buddies.  Another Needler 
will appear on the right side in a bit followed another on the left side.  The 
elevator will begin to descend a bit then it will stop and the elevator doors 
will open.  Face the doorway and climb upwards to reach the... whatever floor 
it is.  It's the third floor actually, but really, who cares at this point!?  A 
cutscene will play.

== Third Floor Hallway ==

Ok, next time, I don't care if Alex has to climb the building, we are not 
taking anymore elevators.  Period.

A woman's humming can be heard from one of the surrounding rooms as Alex starts 
out on this floor.  The door to the left is locked and rubble is blocking the 
way to the east side of the hall.  Turn toward the painting of the lady on the 
right wall and examine it.

Objective Update:

[ ] There seems to be something behind the painting.  Cut it to find out what.

Arm the Combat Knife and walk up to it then initiate the action command to cut 
the painting.  Squeeze through the cut painting.

You'll enter a room that is not even on the map - typical Silent Hill 
tradition. Take the --PHOTO (5/11)-- that is latched onto the door in front of 
Alex.  The door to Room 306 is locked and requires a key.

Objective Update:

[ ] Room 306 has a unique lock.  Find a way to open it.

Duck under the opening in the wall to Alex's left to enter Room 302.

== Room 302 ==

Save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the wall.  Walk out into the hall, 
toward the door with the hole in it (Room 301) to trigger a cutscene.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find three memories for the lady in room 301.

The female voice will tell Alex to bring it a few items (three small windows of 
better days) after choosing "I want to help" then it will go back to humming.  
Creepy.  The person actually wants three photos.

Enter Room 303 and you'll find a message on the left wall by the bed.

"I can't see my face, Maybe you will in 404."

The message will be added under "Clues" in your notebook after examining it.  
Enter Room 304 across the hall.

== Room 304 ==

There is a NOTE TO SAM that you can examine in the cabinet across from the bed. 
Exit the room.

== Third Floor Hallway ==

Move beside the debris in the east and walk through the hole in the wall.  Good 
god man, what the hell is that noise!?  Squeeze through the narrow opening in 
the wall ahead and duck under the opening to the left to enter Room 307.

== Room 307 ==

There is nothing in here.  You can enter the restroom off to the east before 
stepping out into the hall if you want.

== Third Floor Hallway ==

In Room 308 you can find another LETTER TO SAM on the dresser and there is a 
message on the southeast wall of the room above the heater that will be added 
to your journal if it is examined.

"405 scares me.  I left my ducky in there."

You need to get in Room 309 but the door is locked.  The hallway to the north 
has collapsed, so walk around the right (south) side of the hall and you'll 
find a boarded up hole on the east side of Room 309.  Take out the fire axe and 
hack through the boards then enter the room.

== Room 309 ==

Alex will look up toward the ceiling after entering.  Move toward the cabinet 
in the middle of the debris ahead and examine it then climb up onto it and Alex 
will climb to the room above.

== Room 408 ==

Move through the hole in the wall in front of you to enter Room 406.

== Room 406 ==

Examine the NOTE TO CAROL on the dresser then exit the room via the open 
doorway.  The radio will sound off shortly before a Swarm attacks as Alex heads 
for the door.

== Fourth Floor Hallway ==

The door across from Room 406 is jammed.  Take a look at the DELIVERY NOTICE on 
the shelf in between the two chairs to the left as you make your way down the 
hall.  Alex's radio will start to sound as you move further down the hall.

Be sure to turn off your flashlight before you reach the midpoint of the hall.  
A Nurse will charge out of Room 402 and come toward you.  Wait in the middle of 
the hall and she will stop.  Circle around her so that her backside faces Alex 
and perform a strong charged hit with your Fire Axe to damage her greatly then 
finish her with a few more hits.

The doors to Room 404 and 403 are locked.  You can look through a hole on the 
side of the wall and see a message wrote on the wall of the restroom in Room 
403.

"You can't wash it off"

Room 401 is locked but Room 402 is wide open.  As Alex move inside, you'll hear 
more creepy sounds that you have been hearing off and on since Alex was on the 
third floor.  The sound is coming from Room 404.  If you move to the right side 
of the dresser on the left wall, you'll get a push command, so go ahead and 
push it out of the way.  Duck under the hole in the wall behind the dresser.

== Room 404 ==

Hmmm, nothing.  Oh, but the restroom door is wide open!  Move inside the 
restroom and take the ++ALCHEMILLA POSTCARD++ from the medicine cabinet.

The postcard in this room was hinted at by the words in Room 303.  A face 
cannot be seen since the medicine cabinet door is wide open and not revealing 
the outer mirror.

Duck back into Room 402 the exit out into the hallway.

== Fourth Floor Hallway ==

You can't do anything on the west side of the hall, so let's go back to the 
female voice and give her one of her photos.  Notice how the far east end of 
the hallway has a slight red glow to it.  A cutscene will play once Alex walks 
toward the rubble on the east side of the hall.  He's here.

A Swarm will break through the door of Room 405 and attack right after the 
cutscene, so be ready to stomp them or throw them to the ground.  Enter Room 
405.

== Room 405 ==

Walk through the hole in the east wall to get to Room 407.

== Room 407 ==

There is nothing in either of the restroom in this room or the last room, so 
move out into the hallway.

== Fourth Floor Hallway ==

Use the fire axe to hack through the boards to the left of the door to Room 
408.  A Swarm will attack from the other side of the boards.

== Room 408 (Restroom) ==

Pick up the --SERUM (2/8)-- from inside the small case on the sink.  Exit the 
restroom after collecting the serum.

== Fourth Floor Hallway ==

Now, where did chrome dome sneak off to?  Move over to the northeast portion of 
the hall to find some more boards blocking a hole in the wall.  Hack through 
them, Alex!

== East Staircase ==

Well, you won't get very far while trying to go down the stairs, so let's go up 
to the fifth floor.  Jump across the gap in the floor and move through the 
doorway at the top.

== Fifth Floor Hallway ==

A cutscene will play as Alex steps onto the second floor.  The Needler from the 
cutscene will attack directly afterwards.  Oho, there is no elevator frame to 
hide your little skinny ass this time, is there?

The Needler is one of the first of enemies that you can't simply hack away at 
and expect to win.  You'll need to wait for him to attack then duck his attacks 
and hit it from the side preferably with a strong attack.  Watch for one of his 
front arm blades to move then quickly dodge.  The arm swing will fly right over 
Alex as he dodge, so use that time to attack with a counter swing as the 
Needler recovers.  Repeat this method to defeat it.  Eventually the Needler 
will be stunned from constant attacks and that is when you can finish it off. 
If a Needler ever knocks Alex over, be sure to get up quick since it may try to 
sink both claws into Alex while Alex is grounded.  A Needler can be finished 
off easily with any melee weapon.  So long as you can dodge its attacks, Alex 
can eat this thing for breakfast.

The weak point of a Needler is its head and you can shoot at its head with a 
handgun but you have to have some really good accuracy to hit it in the head 
since it is constantly moving.  Its head can be attacked from its front side 
and you won't need to dodge its attacks to do so.  You need to wait for the 
Needler to lift one of its claws to attack then quickly shoot it in its head, 
otherwise it will most likely block the shot.  If you ask me, shooting at a 
Needler is risky since you are more open to its attacks without a melee weapon 
in your hand to dodge or block its attacks.  This is the hint strategy that the 
game points out for you but I don't really care for this method myself.

If you can manage to hit a Needler directly in the head with a melee weapon 
then it will die instantly however.  Don't be surprised if it somehow suddenly 
dies with one hit - you got lucky.

Jump across the gap in the floor along the south side and collect the --HEALTH 
DRINK-- from the small table.  Hop back across and check out the hallway ahead. 
Enter Room 508.

== Room 508 ==

Stomp through the Swarm in the middle of the room then examine the NOTE TO JIM 
on the dresser.  Reenter the hallway and hack through the boards that bar the 
doorway of Room 505.

== Room 505 ==

Push the dresser aside by standing on the right side and using the action 
command then move through the hole in the wall to enter Room 507.

== Room 507 ==

Pick up the ++LAKESIDE AMUSEMENT PARK POSTCARD++ from the bed directly ahead. 
If you look closely, you'll see Robbie the bunny on the postcard!  Scope out 
the nearby restroom to find a --HEALTH DRINK-- on the sink.  Take a look at the 
NOTE TO MR. JONES on the dresser before stepping back into Room 505 and back 
into the outside hallway.

== Fifth Floor Hallway ==

Another Needler will attack from the west side of the hall as Alex reaches the 
mid portion of the hall.  Duck his attacks and perform a charged swing with a 
melee weapon, my boy.  Chop through the boards covering the doorway of Room 
504.

== Room 504 ==

Pick up the --PISTOL AMMUNTION-- from the left side of the bed.  Walk to the 
right side of the dresser on the left side of the room to get a push command. 
Push it out of the way to reveal a --CHILD'S DRAWNING (9/18)--.  Go back 
outside into the hallway.

== Fifth Floor Hallway ==

There is nothing that can be done down the west end of the hallway.  All the 
doors are locked are there are no items.  If you move down the walkway then a 
Needler will crawl out of the hole down the hall and attack Alex on his way 
back to the east.
Find the hole in the wall along the side of Room 503 then duck under it.

== Room 503 ==

Alex will step into the restroom.  Exit the restroom via the open door and walk 
around the right side of the hole in the floor of Room 503.  Examine the hole 
(near the mattress) to see that Alex can climb into the room below.  Climb down 
once the command appears and Alex will drop to a shelf then hop down into the 
room below.

== Room 403 ==

Walk into the restroom and examine the tub below the writing on the wall to 
retrieve the ++TOLUCA LAKE POSTCARD++.

The message above the tub sort of hinted at this postcard lying in the tub.  I 
guess it could also represent the guilt expressed on the writing of the photo.

Alex will mention that he needs to get back to the woman beyond the hole in the 
door of Room 301 and give her memories back to her.  Sounds like a plan to me 
there, guy.

Go back to the shelf with the creepy barbed wire in the back of it and climb on 
top then climb back into Room 503.  Exit Room 503 by ducking under the hole in 
the restroom.

== Fifth Floor Hallway ==

A Needler will attack from the hall to the right as Alex steps out into the 
hall through the hole in the restroom wall.  Time to whip out a melee weapon 
and send him back to... well, wherever these things go when they die.

Another Needler will attack further down the hall to the east.  Move down the 
stairs again and step onto the fourth floor.

== Fourth Floor Hallway ==

Turn off your flashlight as the radio begins to go off.  There is a Nurse by 
the door to Room 407 and another Nurse inside of Room 407.  Sneak up behind 
them and plant an axe into their back or sneak past them while your flashlight 
is turned off.  Enter Room 407 then move through the hold on the west side back 
into Room 405.

== Room 405 ==

The Nurse in Room 406 will sometimes get cranky and move toward Room 405.  Back 
up with your light still off and she will stop eventually.  Step behind her 
then clobber her with your Fire Axe.  She normally stand right inside the dark 
doorway to Room 406.  Step out into the hall then enter Room 406.

== Room 406 == 

Step through the hole in the wall on the east side then enter Room 408.  Climb 
down to the room below via the hole in the floor.

== Room 309 ==

Well, something is certainly creating a ruckus in the outside hall.  A Smog is 
working its way toward this room, so either wait for it to step in go outside 
and defeat it by shooting its lungs when it tries to attack.

== Third Floor Hallway ==

Take a detour through Room 307 to avoid the debris then duck under the hole on 
the west side and squeeze through the narrow opening in the hidden corridor to 
the west.  Before moving toward Room 301, enter Room 302 and save your game at 
the save point - she's not going to bite your hand off or anything, but 
still...

Return to the door to Room 301 and use the "Reach In" action command.  Gotta 
love the tension of reaching into a dark hole in a door.  She will hand over 
the ++STRANGE KEY++ to Alex once all three of her memory items are handed over.

Objective Update:

[ ] Use the key I got from the lady in room 301.

== Room 302 ==

Duck under the hole in the wall on the west wall of Room 302.  Use the Strange 
Key on the door to Room 306 to unlock it then open the door.

Ah, so that's where you've been, you little bastard!  Hiding out in 
undiscovered rooms from your big brother!  Jump across the hole and a cutscene 
will trigger as Alex leaps toward Josh.

== Dining Room ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Search the greenhouse.

Retrieve the --PISTOL AMMUNTION-- and --HEALTH DRINK-- from the first table off 
to the north.  Be sure to save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the east 
wall.  The doors to the lobby cannot be opened, so open the double doors in the 
south.

Enter the hallway beyond the doors.  Move beyond the plants in the hallway and 
check the next set of double doors.  They are locked.  Backtrack to... Oh, 
shit!  Not good, not good!

The plane will switch to Otherworld in real time all around Alex.  Well, now 
the door behind Alex is locked.  The door in front of him is now unlocked, so 
open it and...

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT): If you move against or examine the doors that Alex 
just came through after or during the Otherworld change, the surroundings will 
turn darker and remain darker for this room, the next room, and basically all 
of the area after the boss fight.  I think it remedies itself after the police 
station area, but it makes the journey through the police station extremely 
dark!  Don't step too close to the door that Alex comes through once the 
Otherworld change occurs.

NOTE: If Alex doesn't turn to look back at the doors that he just came through, 
it will not change to Otherworld.  If Alex backs all the way up and turns to 
look at them then it will not change either.  He has to look up at the doors 
with some of the wall above them present for it to change to Otherworld.  
Nothing big, but interesting nonetheless.

== Greenhouse ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Ask Mayor Bartlett what he is doing here.

Mayor Bartlett is up ahead.  Move toward him and speak with him for an 
interactive cutscene.

will be face to face with the first boss of the game.

Objective Update:

[ ] Catch up to Joshua.
[ ] Destroy Sepulcher.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Boss - Sepulcher

If you keep moving to one side (either right or left) this boss cannot hit 
Alex.  Alex can hide behind each of the three dressers that are spread around 
the auditorium to avoid his physical attacks.  Each shelf can only take a 
certain amount of hits before it is destroyed however.  The damage will be 
reflected on the actual shelf to let you know about how much more it can take. 
Once the top half of the shelf has been destroyed then the next hit will 
destroy it and that attack will hit Alex if he is behind it.

Sepulcher only has three attacks:

Punch - Sepulcher holds back either his right or left arm then swings his arm 
forward to punch.

Debris Rain - Sepulcher pounds the ground with both hands and debris falls from 
the ceiling close to Alex.

Arm Swing - While too close, Sepulcher will swing his arm outward.

There are four flesh sacs hanging from the wall around the Greenhouse and you 
need to destroy each of the lower flesh sacs in order to weaken Sepulcher.  
Stand behind a dresser and wait for him to punch the dresser with his fist.  He 
will yell out in pain as he hits the dresser and that is your cue to attack the 
nearest flesh sac.  Take out your handgun and shoot the closest one three times 
to destroy it while he is stunned.  Only reload while you run to the next 
shelf.

You can also attack a sac with the Fire Axe.  Use combo A, A, X to destroy the 
sac.  Sometimes you have to hit it with two combos.  Don't ever stand out in 
the open after the first combo however.  Run back behind a shelf and allow him 
to punch again then run back out and attack the flesh sacs again.

His punches can be avoided by running to the side or locking onto to him then 
pressing the B button to dodge the punch whenever his arm moves.  To avoid his 
debris rain, you'll need to stay running or roll (B + direction) right when he 
pounds the ground.  You'll have to watch out for the debris rain while hiding 
behind the shelves since the shelves won't protect Alex from this particular 
attack.  Don't ever get too close to Sepulcher or he will perform his arm 
swing, which is very hard to dodge while standing still.

Sepulcher will fall from off the ceiling once all four of the lower flesh sacs 
have been destroyed.  He will crawl after Alex at that time and try to swing at 
him or smash him with his arms.

Arm Swing - Sepulcher swings his arm horizontally at Alex.

Arm Smash - Sepulcher swings his arm downward at Alex in an attempt to stab 
him.

Lock onto Sepulcher (hold LT) and wait for him to move an arm then dodge his 
attack by pressing B to avoid the attack.  When you avoid the arm smash, 
Sepulcher will get his arm stuck in the metal floor.  Hit his arm with the Fire 
Axe while it is stuck and Sepulcher will fall to the ground face first.  Equip 
the Fire Axe and run up to his head then attack him with a A, A, X combo.  He 
will get back up, so stun him again by dodging his attacks and hitting his arm. 
Deliver a finishing blow with the X button when the button icon appears to end 
the battle.

Defeating Sepulcher will give you a secret achievement, my friend!

Objective Update:

[ ] Follow Deputy Wheeler through the station.

Deputy Wheeler will open the cell door after Alex speaks of the creatures that 
killed Mayor Bartlett.  There is a POEM written on the wall on the back of 
Alex's cell.  Open the door and step out into the hall where Wheeler went.

== Hallway ==

Wheeler is off to Alex's right.  Follow him into the next room.

== Hallway 2 ==

Follow Wheeler.  He will be scared away from the double doors by a sudden 
rumbling and scream of a creature then he will unlock the door off to the 
right.

== Storage ==

Save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the wall up ahead.  Walk up to Wheeler 
and he will explain that him and Alex need to meet up with Dr. Fitch.  He will 
open up the door against the dark wall.  Follow Wheeler into the main hall.

== Main Hall ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Retrieve my gear from my Dad's Office.

A cutscene will activate and several creatures (Schisms) will attack.  You'll 
be given control of a bare-handed Alex.  Wheeler tells Alex to run toward the 
Chief's Office at the end of the hall.  A Schism will bust through the door of 
the first room to the right as Alex moves toward the door that leads to the 
Chief's Office.  Pick up the --PHOTO (6/11)-- from inside.  The Schisms can 
corner Alex in this room, so be prepared to tap a button represented on the 
button icon that appears if they grab him then run by them.  The Chief's Office 
door is near the end of the hall on the left side - it has a slight bit of 
light shining from underneath the door.

Note: If Alex sticks around in the Main Hall, Deputy Wheeler will eventually 
kill all the Schisms.

== Chief's Office Hallway ==

The Schisms will not follow Alex into this room.  There is a boarded up door 
further ahead but you can't break it just yet.  Find the second door on the 
left wall leading to the Chief's Office then open it and walk inside for a 
cutscene.

== Chief's Office ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Escape the station and meet up with Elle.

Alex will receive the ++12 GAUGE SHOTGUN++ following the cutscene.  Turn on 
your flashlight and arm your fire axe.  Find the ++STATION MAP++ on the small 
shelf by the door - make sure to pick this up!  Rush back out into the Chief's 
Office Hallway.

== Chief's Office Hallway ==

Move toward the boarded up doorway for a cutscene.  Hack through the boarded up 
doorway after the cutscene and run into the room ahead.  In the next room a 
Schism will drop through the ceiling and another one will jump through the 
glass in the office to the right.  This next room can get bad if you don't know 
how to deal with Schisms, which I assume you don't, right?

== Lobby ==

Schisms are hard to fight in any type of group since you don't have the chance 
to focus on their movement while another is nearby - this is why you have to 
approach a group of Schisms with relentless aggression and stomp one of them 
out very quickly so you can deal with the other one by itself.  Right when you 
enter the room, turn to the Schism that jumps through the glass then quickly 
run up to him with the shotgun armed and shoot him in the head.  Shoot him a 
second time while he is on the ground to kill him - you can also pull out the 
handgun or simply hit him with the Fire Axe after the first shotgun blast to 
kill him and conserve shotgun ammo.  You'll get an achievement after the first 
Schism falls.

Achievement unlocked:

-> Split Personality (10G)

Defeated 1 Schism.
-----

In order to fight a Schism properly, you need to learn their attacks and the 
proper timing to dodge them.  A Schism has a slash that it will perform with 
its head, an arm swing, and an uppercut head slash that you can dodge away from 
at close range.  Its long distance attacks are a head slash lunge and a 
grabbing lunge - these are the most damaging, so try to stay close to one while 
fighting it.  X attacks with the Fire Axe from up close work wonders on a 
single Schism, just don't let them back off or they will perform a long 
distance attack.  The A, A, X combo from the pipe can work well against them 
once a move of theirs has been dodged also.

Three more Schisms will bust through a door to the side if you defeat both of 
the first two.  There is absolutely nothing down the hallway where the second 
group of three Schisms appear from, so don't even bother fighting off the 
second Schism in the first group unless you enjoy the combat in this game that 
much.  Three of them together are a major pain in the ass.

Allow the second Schism to survive then hop through the opening of the broken 
window that one of Schisms broke through earlier and collect the --HEALTH 
DRINK-- from the top of the file cabinet inside.  Hop back through the window 
and enter the restroom through the door on the left side of the room (second 
door to the left) then collect the --HEALTH DRINK-- off of the fourth sink.  
There is another restroom on the opposite side of the room outside, but there 
is nothing inside except for a dead body in the second stall.  The exit doors 
are locked, naturally.

Run through the open door next to the broken glass.  All doors are locked along 
the way.  Duck under the hole in the wall off to the left at the end of the 
corridor.  

== Briefing Room ==

Two Schisms will attack in this room.  Arm your shotgun and run up to the 
closest one then shoot it once to knock it down and blast it again with the 
shotgun or handgun while it lies on the ground.  Take out the Fire Axe and 
defeat the last Schism with X swings from up close.  Don't let it get too far 
away.  You can also learn its attacks and dodge them then counter it with some 
counter attacks, but you really need to know its attacks well to do this.

Pick up the --SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- from the file cabinet behind the desk.  Walk 
toward the boarded up doorway on the southeast side of the room and chop 
through the boards with your Fire Axe.

== Hallway to Garage ==

The two doors to the left are jammed, so move to the south down the hall.  The 
door along the right side is jammed to, so continue to the garage door and open 
it.

== Garage ==

A Schism will knock away some metal barrels to the right as Alex enters the 
garage.  Run toward him and hit him with constant X swings with the fire axe. 
You could also use two shotgun blasts if you are afraid of getting hit.  
Examine the WRINKLED MEMO on the black police car next to the small office for 
a clue to a puzzle inside of the office.  Enter the office on the west side of 
the garage.

++ LOCKER PUZZLE ++

The metal cabinet off to the right is locked and needs a number combination to 
open it.  The combination is in this room!  Recall the words on the wrinkled 
memo outside.

"Only time will tell who has the will to live."

Look at the clock.  The time is 2:06, so enter "206" for the combination.  
Voila!  Collect the --SHOTGUN AMMUNITION--, --HEALTH DRINK-- and --PISTOL AMMO-
- from inside.

Walk over to the lever on the far wall and pull it.  This will make the garage 
door open.  Move toward the garage door then duck under it to trigger a 
cutscene.

Objective Update:

[ ] Rescue Elle.

My god.  We have a feisty one!  This particular creature is called a Siam.

A Siam is super aggressive and just running around will not always guarantee 
that Alex will avoid its attacks.  Take out the shotgun and shoot it three 
times to finish it.  Hit it with two shots right at the beginning while it 
roars and you might even be able to sneak in the third and final shot.  You can 
also use the handgun and shoot it 7 times to defeat it.  The special part about 
using the handgun is that each shot will stagger it even while it attacks, so 
this will help to delay its attacks.

Don't try to run from a Siam since it will easily catch up with Alex and combo 
him with its attacks.  Fighting it with just a firearm can sometimes be deadly 
since it is hard to dodge its attacks with only a roll and no dodge (like when 
Alex has a melee weapon equipped), but using a melee weapon against one is 
incredibly hard.  It's weak portion is the feminine legs on its back, but 
getting to them is quite hard even with well-timed dodging.  It only takes 
three shotgun blasts or seven handgun blasts to kill a Siam so spam it with 
blasts from either weapon to finish it off quickly.  You'll get an achievement 
for beating it.

__________________________ _ SHEPHERD'S GLEN SEWERS _ _________________________

== Gate 13 Area ==

Objective Update

[ ] Keep Elle safe.

[ ] Find a way out of the sewers.

Elle will follow Alex for this journey through the sewers.  Jump off the 
current raised portion and down into the tunnel ahead.  There is an area down 
the right tunnel further ahead that Alex can step up to but it only leads to a 
dead end with nothing.

Elle will call Alex's attention to a valve handle near a gate marked with the 
number 3.  Walk over to the valve handle and rotate it - tap the A button while 
holding it.  Alex will hold the gate open long enough for Elle to slip through. 
Elle will move up under the gate then run over to the valve handle on the other 
side and rotate it just enough to Alex can duck under the gate.

== Gate 4 Area ==

Turn left at the debris down the waterway tunnel ahead then step up to the 
raised portion of the tunnel on the left.  Walk to the other side of the raised 
area then step down into the knee deep water.  I wonder what lurks in here... 
hmmm.  Elle will eventually get frightened as a Lurker moves out of the water 
up ahead.  The Fire Axe has a chance to kill a Lurker instantly with any swing 
- an X swing is a guaranteed head chop.  The Lurkers in this area seem to run 
straight toward Elle at times, so turn her way if one of them suddenly 
disappears.  Another Lurker will rise up from the water and attack once you 
pass the rusted bus to the right.

== Gate 12 Area ==

Climb up to the next raised area.  Walk to the far right and pick up the 
--PISTOL AMMO-- and other --PISTOL AMMO-- on the blue tank if needed.  Step 
down into the next waterway tunnel and walk toward the light that is entering 
from the grating above.  Step up onto the left raised portion then take out 
your steel pipe and pry the gate open.  Rotate the valve handle on the water 
pump off to the left to lower the water level in the pool further ahead.  Step 
back down to the waterway tunnel and follow it to the left.  Step up to the 
next tunnel off to the right at the end of the current one then follow it.

== Bilge Tank Area ==

There is a ladder to the left that can now be climbed down if Alex lowered the 
water level down the last tunnel but don't move down it just yet.  Move further 
ahead and save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the right wall around the 
left corner.

Enter the room past the save point and walk over to the dead body on the bed.  
Pick up the ++SEWER MAP++ and the ++SHOTGUN AMMUNITION++.  If you look past the 
grating of the torn wall to the side, you'll find some human remains among the 
wall debris.  Exit the room and climb or drop down into the small pool below 
the ladder outside - remember you need to have lowered the water by rotating 
the valve handle in the last tunnel a few moments ago.

== Bilge Tank ==

Run through the knee deep water then climb the ladder at the other end.  There 
is nothing down the waterway to the left in the next area, so step down to the 
right waterway.  The area past Gate 9 has nothing special behind it so stepping 
under it is rather useless.  Move to the south along the current waterway.  
Step up to the raised area along the left side and take the --HEALTH DRINK-- 
from the indention along the side of the wall then step back down to the 
waterway.  Keep following the waterway to the end and you'll arrive at Gate 8. 
Life before, rotate the valve handle to raise the gate and let Elle under.

== Gate 8 Area ==

Elle will not be able to raise the gate from the other side but she tells Alex 
of another gate to the side that she could raise for him if he met her on the 
other side.  So, well, we backtrack a bit.  Move back up the waterway tunnel.  
A Needler probably heard the plans of the two because he will attack Alex on 
the way back up the waterway tunnel.  Take out the fire axe and dodge his 
attacks then attack him from the side.  Turn left at the end of the tunnel then 
step up onto the raised area.  Another Needler will step out from the waterway 
directly ahead.

Step off into the waterway that the Needler comes from once he is defeated.  
Turn left and climb back down the ladder and into the knee deep water below.  
Climb up the next ladder then save your game at the save point around the left 
corner.  Step off into the waterway next to Gate 12.

== Gate 12 Area ==

Continue to the south and go back to the area with the standing water in front 
of Gate 4.  A single Lurker will attack from the shallow water.  Run all the 
way back to Gate 4 and Elle will rotate the valve handle on the other side to 
open it for Alex.  Duck under the gate.

== Gate 8 Area ==

A Needler will race down the waterway up ahead shortly after the gate falls.  
Follow the waterway to the east then step up to the raised area on the right 
side in the middle of the waterway then pick up the --SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- from 
the inside the big pipe on the back wall.  Step back down and follow the 
waterway to the northeast.  A Needler will attack from near the end of the 
tunnel.  Step up to the raised area off to the left.

== Sluice Drain Area ==

Climb down the ladder off to the right.  Step across the metal bridge and Alex 
will reach the spillway that has a shallow pool in the middle.  Well, what are 
you waiting for?  Jump right in.  The water's fine!

Or not.  You know the drill by now.  There are only two Lurkers in the water, 
so kill off the first one near the middle then the last one near the end.  Elle 
will jump into the water and follow Alex eventually.  Step up onto the east 
side of the Spillway.  The door to the left is sealed, so climb the ladder on 
the south wall.

Follow the corridor to the west and a Needler will attack.  Defeat him then 
continue to the west and pick up the --PISTOL AMMO-- and --SHOTGUN AMMO-- from 
the right wall.  Venture back to the east and find the lever on the right wall, 
next to a light, then pull it to open the gate on the wall in the east.  Move 
into the Drop area.

== Drop Area ==

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT): If you venture further into the tunnel and defeat any 
enemies up ahead then come back and save your game at the save point mentioned 
below then you will fall victim to one of Silent Hill Homecomings many game 
bugs/glitches.  Read on ahead if you're worried about this.

Run to the far north and drop off the edge of the high platform.  Before 
dropping again, look off to the right and move through the doorway then save 
your game at the !!SAVE POINT!!.

Walk back through the doorway then drop to the waterway in the north.  Continue 
to the Main Drain Chamber.  There is nothing in the areas along the west and 
north side of the waterway.

== Main Drain Chamber ==

Find the valve handle in the north and rotate it so that Elle can move up under 
Gate 15.  I have a feeling as to what is going to happen here...

Elle will not be able to open the gate on the other side but she will head down 
the remainder of the tunnel.  Well, I was half right, no boss at least.  Turn 
around and move back into the Main Drain Chamber.  Three Needlers will step out 
from the side walls.  It's really up to you how you want to fight them.  The 
Fire Axe still works well but I would recommend working them away from each 
other and only concentrating on one at a time.  Most of the time, while Alex is 
locked onto one, they will fight him one on one.

Once the three Needlers fall, you'll hear Elle scream.  Shortly afterward, a 
Siam will enter the room and attack from the tunnel that Alex and Elle just 
came from.  To defeat him easily, aim your handgun directly down the tunnel and 
watch for the cursor to turn red.  Wait for it to step into view then shoot him 
7 times to defeat it.  Otherwise, pump three shotgun blasts into it to finish 
it off.  The Siam will ram right through the pillars in the room, so you can't 
hide behind them.  The gate that Elle went through will fully open once the 
Siam is defeated.

TIP: If you run all the way back down the tunnel that leads to the drain area 
and stand on top of the car in that area then the Needlers will not be able to 
hit Alex.  They usually will not enter the area with the car and they will 
sometimes turn their back to Alex while attempting to get inside.  This works 
for the Siam as well - it will turn its back to Alex quite a bit while Alex 
stands inside of the area with the car.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT): Do not try to go back and save your game while 
fighting the three Needlers.  One reader emailed and told me that Elle respawns 
at the save point and you'll have to reopen the gate, then the Siam will appear 
if you die then reload your game.  If you fail to kill the Siam at that point, 
then he will not appear when the game is continued and this will cause a game 
bug to where your brightness level will fall and the game will remain dark for 
the rest of the playthrough, much like the bug deal with the Otherworld 
transition at the Grand Hotel.

Move down the waterway beyond the gate.  Be sure to step up onto the raised 
area hallway down the waterway and pick up the --PHOTO (7/11)-- from the floor 
up above.  Step back down into the waterway then continue to the north.  Alex 
will run across a blood trail along with Elle's radio and automatically examine 
the horrid site.  Continue to the north then climb the ladder.


________________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ _______________________

Alex will emerge near his house on Craven Avenue in Shepherd's Glen.  The front 
door to the Shepherd House is sealed off with barbed wire, so we can't go in 
there at the moment.  Go south on Craven Avenue and a cutscene will play.

Objective Update:

[ ] Go to Doc Fitch's office.

Wheeler wants Alex to meet him at Dr. Fitch's Office.  Two Ferals will attack 
along the way to the south, so have your Combat Knife ready.  Use the A, A, A, 
X combo on them and focus on one at a time.  The knife will kill them fast 
enough to where they won't be able to do much as a pair - these type of enemies 
are hard to run from, so I wouldn't recommend running here.  Enemies will now 
spawn randomly on the streets of Shepherd's Glen, so don't keep fighting them 
if they surround Alex, just run the best way you can even if Alex has to run 
from Ferals.  Take this chance to go back to the Town Hall in the south.  There 
is still a boarded up portion over a door that needs to be chopped down in 
there.


________________________________ _ TOWN HALL _ ________________________________

A Smog might attack in the main hallway that stretches across the Town Hall, so 
prepare the handgun - sometimes he doesn't appear.  Chop through the boards on 
the north side of the Town Hall and open the door.  Be sure to examine the 
PORTRAIT OF ISAAC SHEPHERD on the table.  There is a hidden secret in this 
room.  Walk over to the left side of the shelf on the left wall to get a push 
command.  Push the shelf aside and take the --CHILD'S DRAWING (10/18)-- from 
the wall behind the shelf.  Save your game in the room next to Judge Holloway's 
Office before leaving.  Exit the Town Hall and step back out into the streets.


________________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ _______________________

You need to go toward Dr. Fitch's office which is to the west on Main Street. 
Don't even pay attention to the enemies along the way.  They will group up on 
Alex if you try to fight them and they will surely take some valuable health. 
We're talking Ferals and Schisms here, so just run!  Roll to the Dr. Fitch's 
Office door if you have to.

A trail of blood will become visible on the way to Dr. Fitch's office.  A 
cutscene will play eventually.  Enter Dr. Fitch's office via the front door 
after the cutscene.

                                                                         [WT07]
____________________________ _ DR. FITCH'S OFFICE _ ___________________________
 
== Reception ==

Move through the doorway to the side of the reception counter and step behind 
the counter then pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the far left counter.  
Examine the SOUTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY DEGREE next to the door against the right 
wall.  The door will not open so move down the dark corridor ahead.

All the doors are locked except for the door at the very end on the right.  
There is a fallen shelf by it.  Open the door and enter the room.

== Scarlet's Room ==

Move over to the cabinet on the left side of the room and take the --PHOTO 
(8/11)--.  The case on the dresser directly ahead is locked and requires a key. 
Be sure to check it.  Walk to the door and leave the room.

== Front Reception ==

As you walk up to the door, the radio will go off.  Don't leave the room with 
the light on!  There are five Nurses standing in the outside corridor to the 
left.  Kill them in the dark.  There is a light on at the end of the left hall 
that should help you see them.  Walk down the hall and find the door that used 
to be closed next to the reception.  It is now wide open, so enter the room.

== Examination Room ==

Collect the ++SMALL KEY++ from the bed off to the right and read the NOTE TO 
MR. FITCH.  Walk over to the medical case and examine it then take the --SERUM 
(3/8)--.  Exit the room then go back to the room down the hall on the right.

== Scarlet's Room ==

Use the Small Key to unlock the case on top of the dresser and cutscene will 
play.

_________________________ _ DR. FITCH'S OFFICE (OW) _ _________________________

== Scarlet's Room (OW) ==

Objective update:

[ ] Investigate the area.

Alex will pick up ++SCARLET'S DOLL++ after the cutscene.  The entrance that 
Alex came through is now boarded up with boards that he cannot chop through.  
Move through the narrow corridor to the side of the room and climb down when 
prompted.


_______________________________ _ HELL DESCENT _ ______________________________

Josh will appear off in the distance then he will run to the right as Alex gets 
close to him.  If you follow Josh down the stairs then you will arrive at a 
dead end cliff in the middle of the stairway and won't be able to go any 
further down the stairs.  Alex needs to tie a leash around that kid when he 
finally catches him.  Go back and turn to the left then follow that staircase 
all the way down.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Joshua.

Keep going straight ahead even when you get on the catwalks.  Make when a left 
when Alex is forced to. Turn to the right once the path splits.  The path down 
the stairs directly ahead will lead to another cliff dead end.  Hop across the 
gap along the right path then tap the A button to grab onto the other side.

Move ahead and you'll have a choice of two paths once again.  The right path 
will lead to another dead end cliff.  Take the left path.  When you reach the 
"Emergency and Ambulance Entrance" sign pointing to the right, turn to the 
right and hop into the open space in the wall.

Turn left and move down the hall.  Hop over the fan.  The fan that is below 
Alex up ahead is not on, so you can drop down through this fan.  If you move 
down the corridor to the right and examine the doll at the end, "Behind you" 
will be displayed on the screen and a Smog monster will appear behind Alex and 
attack, so don't examine the doll.  Drop down through the fan.

When you drop, a Swarm will attack, so be ready to stomp some bugs.  Pick up 
the --PISTOL AMMO-- from the table then move down the next corridor and drop to 
the catwalk below.  Move down the stairs to the right.  Hop across the gap at 
the bottom then move up the next set of stairs.  You'll eventually reach a 
point where you can drop to some stairs below a catwalk.  Drop down to the 
stairs since the catwalk will end momentarily.

Move up the new set of stairs in front of Alex then take the --HEALTH DRINK-- 
from the table with the doll on it.  Run back down the stairs and go the other 
way.  Walk around the catwalk as it trails off to the left.  Keep moving until 
you come to a split.  You'll see Josh run by and move to the left but when Alex 
moves around the left corner a Smog will attack.  Defeat the Smog down the left 
path.  Walk down the right path that Josh came from and pick up the --CHILD'S 
DRAWING (11/18)-- from the catwalk.  The right path ends very quickly, so 
follow the left path.

Jump over to the bridge directly ahead.  Turn left and follow the bridge then 
drop down when prompted.  Turn around then find the catwalk tunnel to the right 
and move down that tunnel.  Climb down the ladder off to the left.  Facing the 
bottom of the ladder, the left path will only lead to a jammed door, so take 
the right path and drop down to the area below that it leads to.

From the area where you drop down, there are two ways to go.  Go forward first 
then you'll have to backtrack to this area again.  Hop over the lava pool ahead 
then move down the tunnel off to the right.  Find the section without wall 
along the right side of the tunnel then drop down. Some cages are to Alex's 
right - one of them has a body bag in it.  Turn left and climb down the ladder. 
Some more body bags in cages will be behind Alex as he steps off the ladder.  
Run straight ahead then turn once you get to the fallen cages.  Squeeze through 
the pipes along the right wall then duck under the fan directly ahead.  Take 
the ++CROWBAR++ from the table.  The door to the side of the table is locked 
and can't be opened.

Go back the way you came.  Duck under the fan, squeeze through the pipes, run 
back to the ladder and- holy god, bad body bag in a cage, bad!  Sorry.  Climb 
the ladder again then step up to the tunnel up ahead and turn left then follow 
it to the lava pool and hop back over the pool.  Now Alex is back at the area 
where you dropped from earlier and were give a choice of paths.

Take the other path this time and I will lead the way.  Hop over the lava to 
land on the slender catwalk then move to the right and step down.  Climb down 
the ladder.  Turn left and move toward the fan that is on.  Pull the lever on 
the right wall to turn the fan off.  It will eventually stop and the bottom 
portion will be open just enough to pass through.  Duck under the fan then move 
down the stairs ahead and drop down to the area below.  Turn around and move 
toward the fan.  Josh can be seen on the other side of the fan as Alex 
approaches it but Josh will quickly stand up and haul ass before Alex can give 
him a spanking with that new crowbar we just found.  Duck under the fan.

The fan will start up once Alex is on the other side of it.  Pick up the 
--CHILD'S DRAWING (12/18)-- from the floor near the fan.  Turn to the right.  
The first path to the right will only lead to a dead end with a fence blocking 
the end.  Continue directly ahead and make a left to follow the tunnel in that 
direction.  Three fans will be at the end of the tunnel.  One of them is off, 
so step toward that particular fan and duck under it.  The door ahead is jammed 
and will not open.  Turn to the left and take out the Combat Knife then cut the 
skin wall and squeeze through it.

A Swarm will attack, so stomp them and throw them off if they attach to Alex.  
Find the lever on the wall then pull it to stop the fan.  Duck under the fan 
after it stops.  You're now back in the area with the three fans outside of the 
tunnel but by pulling the switch on the other side, the fan on the floor has 
stopped, so drop through it.  Follow the path ahead then move down the tunnels.

++ FAN PUZZLE ++

You'll eventually enter an area with a bunch of fans with numbers in the middle 
of them.  Some of the fans are on and some of them are off.

-----
Off = 3 - 4 - 2

On = 5 - 6 - 1
-----
Left side = 3 - 2 - 1

Right side = 4 - 5 - 6
-----

Before you do anything here, duck up under Fan 3 then duck up under Fan 2 and 
take the --SERUM (4/8)-- in the medical case on the table beyond Fan 2.

You need to pull the levers along the sides of the fans in a certain order.

To give you a simple solution, here is the order that will turn off the fans on 
the right side:

4|5    3|4    5|6    4|5    2|3    3|4

Here is a more detailed explanation as to what exactly goes on during this 
process.

1) Pull the "4|5" switch to make fan 5 turn off and make fan 4 turn on.

2) Pull the "3|4" switch to make fan 4 turn off and fan 3 turn on.

3) Pull the "5|6" switch to make fan 6 turn off and fan 5 turn on.

4) Pull the "4|5" switch to make fan 5 turn off and fan 4 turn on.

5) Pull the "2|3" switch to make fan 3 turn off and fan 2 turn on.

6) Pull the "3|4" switch to make fan 4 turn off and fan 3 turn on.

Now fans 4, 5 and 6 are turned off, so Alex can duck under all the fans on the 
right side and make his way through them.

Turn to the left after stepping through the fans and find the ladder at the end 
of the tunnel.  Climb down the ladder.  Move past the ladder at the bottom and 
you'll find a !!SAVE POINT!! on the wall ahead.  Save your game!

Climb down the ladder across from the save point.  Josh will be in view as Alex 
climbs down the ladder then he will quickly run ahead of Alex.  Follow the 
catwalk that he runs along.

Objective Update:

[ ] Investigate the area.

A cutscene will show the wall ahead as it breaks open to reveal a tunnel.  The 
lights in each section of the tunnel will shut off in sequence and stay off.  
Move down the dark tunnel.  Make a right at the end and the area will light up 
and showcase a door directly ahead as all sound stops except for a slight 
buzzing.  Something tells me that door is meant to be opened, so let's not 
disappoint.  Open the door.

Step into the room with the giant overhead fan then move toward Dr. Fitch as he 
kneels in the center of the room.

Note: Dr. Fitch will cut himself while Alex is away from him then he will stop 
and look up as Alex gets closer.  He will go back to cutting himself if Alex 
moves away from him again.  Such a waste of good suffering... give this man a 
puzzle box, he needs to explore some Hellraiser cenobite pleasures.

Speak with the good doctor for a interactive cutscene.

Objective Update

[ ] Defeat Scarlet.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Boss - Scarlet

Arm Swipe - Scarlet will lean one of her arms back and swipe the ground in 
front of her with her long arm.  Sometimes she will stop with one hit but 
sometimes she will pause and perform another swipe going the other direction.

Blood Eruption - Scarlet leans an arm back and pounds the ground, creating a 
spurt of blood as her hand hits the ground.

Scarlet is really not that much of a problem.  She's really fights just like a 
slightly bigger normal enemy in my view.  It can be hard to understand how to 
hit her without getting hit yourself at first however.

Alex can't take cover anywhere during this battle.  You have to rely on the 
dodge button.  She has a two hit arm swipe attack where she will try to hit 
Alex with one of her arms then pause and then try to hit him with the other 
arm.  This combo must be dodged one swipe right after the other.  Once the 
first swipe is dodged, pause a bit and then dodge the second swipe.  She is 
left wide open to an attack at that point, so quickly hit either her right or 
left leg with a charged X attack from the Crowbar.  You can use the Fire Axe 
but the Crowbar is a bit safer since the hit is faster.  The Combat Knife is 
useless against her thanks to her porcelain exterior.

Do not go beyond a single charged strong attack since Alex will likely get hit 
if you try to add in an X swing.  Scarlet will sometimes perform a single swipe 
instead of a double swipe.  She can do this often at times.  You really should 
prepare for a double swipe however to keep from getting hit period.  When she 
only performs a single hit, you might want to hit her with a counter attack or 
A swing since you'll likely hit her late while anticipating a second swipe.

She has a move where she will pound the ground with her fist and blood will fly 
up from the ground.  It's hard to tell this move from the normal swipe since 
Scarlet is so tall, so you'll really just have to risk it and press the dodge 
button in hope to avoid this move.  It can be dodged just like the swipe but it 
takes a slightly different timed button press when compared to the swipes.  
Alex will roll behind her after dodging the ground pound and you can easily get 
in some hits after this move.  Sometimes Alex will roll away from her though.  
She basically gives Alex an opportunity for a free charged hit every time that 
she yells while standing in place, so be sure to charge a swing to hit her at 
that time.

After suffering enough damage her hard porcelain shell will begin to fall off 
and her inner skin will be shown.  You must knock off the hard porcelain from 
both of her legs and continue to damage her legs until she falls.  When she 
falls, perform an A, A, charge X combo or simply hit her with continuous 
charged X swings with the Crowbar.  You need to knock off all portions of 
porcelain on her upper half as well.  She will get up a few times after Alex 
knocks her down, so you'll have to dodge her attacks once again and hit her in 
the legs to make her fall again.  Making her fall a second or third time is not 
hard at all since her weak skin is already revealed; she will fall within a few 
swings or one charged swing.  If you can time it just right then you can 
actually hit her with a charged X swing right as she rises to knock her back 
down when she tries to get up.  Once she has taken enough damage while she has 
fallen over, the X button icon will appear while standing next to her, so press 
the X button followed by the next button that appears to finish her off in a 
cutscene!

SPECIAL NOTE: If you keep failing the tap sequence then don't tap the button so 
button so fast.  It has come to my attention that this is why some gamers have 
a problem with this fight.  Supposedly, if you tap the button too fast the 
sequence will not allow you to continue.

Oh, but she is not finished just yet!  She will now stand on her legs and hands 
and move toward Alex then try to slap him.  Watch for her to lean downward then 
dodge to avoid the attack.  Her far off lunge is easiest to dodge since she 
will give off more of warning by holding her arms down and jumping.  Both 
attacks are very fast.  She is hard to hit during this stage of the battle 
because she is constantly moving, but there is one move that she performs that 
is her downfall.  Read on below the moves.

Slap - Scarlet leans down slightly before she performs a quick slap forward 
with one of her arms while in close range.

Double Slap - Scarlet holds both of her arms downward then quickly jumps in the 
air and lunges forward with both hand.

Ceiling Attack - Scarlet jumps to the ceiling then waits.  A button prompt will 
appear slightly before she lands on Alex.  Press the button and Alex will roll 
away from this move and Scarlet will stun herself.  If she lands on Alex then 
press the button that appears to break her grip.

Eventually, she will jump to the wall and climb to the ceiling.  You have to 
watch for a sudden B button tapping at this time.  If you tap the button at the 
right time then Alex will roll out of the way of Scarlet's attack and you will 
be able to run up to her and deliver a heavy attack with the tap of the X 
button when the icon appears.  This will damage her greatly and three of these 
type of attacks will finish her for good.  If you fail to respond to the 
ceiling attack with a button press then she will jump on Alex and you will have 
to fight her off by tapping the button that appears during the grab sequence.

If you want to make this battle easy, then the best time to hit her is after 
avoiding her ceiling grab.  Simply run up to her and tap the X button and Alex 
will use the crowbar to stab her in the chest.  If you choose to hit after an 
attack then you're going to have a tough time with this boss.  Just keep your 
distance from her and let her jump to the ceiling then avoid the attack and hit 
her with a strong attack while she is stunned.

You will receive an achievement after defeating her and a cutscene will play.

____________________________ _ DR. FITCH'S OFFICE _ ___________________________

== Scarlet's Room ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Investigate the Town Hall.

Alex will receive the ++FOUNDERS KEY++ after the cutscene.  This key goes in 
the slot of podium in the middle room of the Town Hall.  Leave Dr. Fitch's 
Office by stepping out the front door back into the streets of Shepherd's Glen. 
Head east on Main Street and enter the Town Hall through the front door.  Run 
and roll away from the monsters out on the streets.

                                                                         [WT08]
________________________________ _ TOWN HALL _ ________________________________

You may want to save your game at the save point in the northeast room.  
Killing the Smogs in this building is really a waste of ammo since they 
constantly respawn - your choice.  Enter the middle room with the large podium 
and paintings of the founding fathers.

== Founders Room ==

Walk behind the podium on the east end of the room and use the Founders Key 
when prompted to use an item.  The middle portion of the floor will rise up to 
reveal a stairway below the Town Hall.

Move down the stairs and pick up the --FIRST AID KIT-- under the archway in the 
wall directly ahead.  Move down either tunnel along the right or left side.  
They both lead the same way, so it doesn't matter.  Turn off your flashlight 
and enter the narrow tunnel.  Three Nurses are in the large room ahead, so be 
ready to sneak up on them and beat them down with whatever melee weapon of your 
choosing.

== Basement ==

This room has a twisted tree root growing out of the ceiling.  There are 
altogether four ANCIENT BOOKS that can be read in this room.  Two of them are 
to the sides of the tunnel that Alex uses to enter this area and the other two 
are on the opposite wall.  Examine the cross on the right side of the room to 
trigger a cutscene.  Alex will receive the ++CEREMONIAL DAGGER++ after the 
cutscene.  This dagger will take the place of the Combat Knife from now on.

Now, what in the world do we do next?  Well, believe it or not, there is a door 
with a slot to the side of it in between the two books directly across from the 
tunnel that Alex used to enter this area.  The door blends right in the wall, 
so walk in between the two books and you'll get an "Unlock" command.  Equip the 
Ceremonial Dagger and give the command to unlock the door.

Enter the area beyond the door then make a right and follow that tunnel and 
then turn right again. Follow the next tunnel and the path will split.  Turn 
left and move forward then follow the tunnel to the right.  You'll arrive at a 
four way split.  The right and straight paths are dead ends, so go right.  Keep 
moving straight ahead then take the second left.

At the end of the next tunnel, Alex will enter a room with a desk off to the 
left with a typewriter on it.  Climb up the ladder on the side wall.  Alex will 
surface in one of the east mausoleum's in the Founders Garden of the Rose 
Heights Cemetery.


__________________________ _ ROSE HEIGHTS CEMETERY _ __________________________

== Founders Garden ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Traverse the Cemetery and enter the Shepherd House from the backyard.

Turn to the left while still standing near the top of the ladder and take the 
--CHILD'S DRAWING (13/18)-- from off the left wall.  Equip the Ceremonial 
Dagger once again and unlock the door to the mausoleum with it.

Use the Ceremonial Dagger to unlock the other mausoleum right across from the 
current one then step inside and open the medical case on the right coffin then 
take the --SERUM (5/8)-- from inside.

If you want to get all of the photos in this game then you need to do a little 
bit of backtracking to the east street outside of the Rose Heights Cemetery.  
Move out the north gate of the Founder's Garden and enter the West Garden then 
keep heading north to the Parking Lot and exit through the gate on the east 
side.


_______________________ _ STREETS OF SHEPHERD'S GLEN _ ________________________

The only monster around here is a Smog in the far west.  Move to the west down 
Main Street and walk over to the Missing Persons billboard where Elle was 
posting up papers earlier.  There is a --PHOTO (9/11)-- lying on the ground in 
front of the right side of the billboard.

Since you're already here, hell, why not do some more backtracking?  Run to the 
far south portion of River View Road and simply move by the Smogs along the 
way.  Run across the bridge and pick up the --SHOTGUN AMMUNITION--, another 

--SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- and --HEALTH DRINK-- from off the ground right near the 
fence to the Junkyard.  The gate to the Junkyard is locked.  You need to go 
back to the backyard of the Shepherd House now, so head back to the Founders 
Garden of the Cemetery where Alex exited from the mausoleum.

__________________________ _ ROSE HEIGHTS CEMETERY _ __________________________

== Founders Garden ==

Move up the stairs on the south side of the garden then head to the west and 
drop down into the pit.  The opening Alex used before is blocked this time so 
duck under the opening on the north wall.

Two Smogs will attack on the other side, so blast their lungs with the handgun 
when they open up their chests to show their glowing lungs - you can use the 
shotgun for a one hit kill while aiming for their lungs.  Run to the very end 
and collect the --FIRST AID KIT-- and --SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- from the ground on 
the north side.  Backtrack and find the opening in the west wall then duck 
under it.

== Founders Row ==

Climb up out of the pit then move through the gate.  A Smog will be to the 
right, so blast him with the handgun.  Squeeze through the narrow hole in the 
wall in between the tombs on the west wall to get back into one of the crypts 
in the Family Crypts Mid Area.

== Family Crypts Mid ==

Exit the crypt then move through the iron gate to the west.  Enter the last 
crypt on the left and duck under the hole in the west wall then exit the next 
crypt.  Enter the last crypt on the right then squeeze through the narrow 
opening in the north wall.

== Family Crypts North ==

After exiting the crypt, take out the Fire Axe and chop through the wooden 
boards that block the crypt directly ahead.  Take the ++'CHROME HAMMER' 
PISTOL++ from the floor in between the coffins.  This takes the place of the 
normal handgun.  Exit the crypt then move through the iron gate in the east.  
Save your game at the save point in the first crypt to the left.  Push open the 
next iron gate in the east then step out to the East Garden.

== East Garden ==

The gate to the Bartlett Mausoleum is once again closed, but Alex doesn't need 
to go that way anyway.  Drop off the side of the hill to the north.  Two Ferals 
will attack as soon as Alex hits the ground near the fountain below.  Take out 
the Ceremonial Dagger and fight them off with it.  Run to the east side of this 
low area and climb up to the area above.

== Old Crypts ==

Go through the door of the crypt up ahead then move down the path of tombs.  
Move through the crypt at the end of the path and look through the crypt to the 
left to see a Smog coming toward Alex.  Defeat the Smog then move through the 
next crypt.

Run through the Old Crypts area, as labeled on your map then move down the 
catwalk area and step out onto Barker Street.  Alex is once again behind his 
house.  Open the back gate.

                                                                         [WT09]
_____________________________ _ SHEPHERD HOUSE _ ______________________________

Objective Update:

[ ] The basement door is locked.  I wonder if I can open it?

There's no place like home!  Walk up the stairs and step onto the back porch. 
Open the back door.

Take out the Fire Axe and chop through the boards covering the door on the 
right side of the kitchen.  Open the door to enter the dining room.  Take the 
--FIRST AID KIT-- from off the desk on the right side of the room.  The other 
doors are locked, so exit the house.

Walk around the side of the house next to the doghouse then move down the 
stairs and reenter the basement by going down the stairs across from the 
doghouse and opening the door.  Squeeze through the cut sheet on the left wall 
almost directly across from the basement stairs.  Equip the Ceremonial Dagger 
and use it to unlock the door behind the cut sheet.  Open the door and step 
inside.

Good ole' dad left behind his shotgun, so walk over to the cabinet on the left 
side of the room and pick up the ++'BLUESTEEL' SHOTGUN++.  This shotgun can 
hold 5 bullets at a time and Schisms fear it greatly since it will defeat them 
in one shot!  Move over to the table directly ahead and pick up the ++ATTIC 
KEY++.  Exit the room then squeeze back through the sheet.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find a way into the attic.

Run up the stairs and step back into the front room of the house.  Mom's still 
in the living room in her near death state, so let's leave her be.  Move up the 
stairs to the second floor.  Walk around the left corner and approach the door 
to the attic at the end of the second floor hall.  Use the Attic Key on the 
door to unlock it then open the door.  Hmmm, there is nothing in this first 
room except for an old flickering TV.  Let's try door number 2 up ahead and to 
the left.

Ah, the attic!  Move up the stairs.  Walk past the sheet to the left and pick 
up the --PHOTO (10/11)-- from off the boxes covered with a sheet.  What a 
creepy looking photo.  Walk over to the bookshelf almost directly across from 
the stairs and stand on the left side of it to get a push command.  Push the 
shelf aside to find a door.  Open the door to trigger a cutscene.

Step inside of the attic room after the cutscene.  Check out the CERTIFICATE OF 
RELEASE OR DISCHARGE FROM ACTIVE DUTY on the right desk.  Walk over to the 
emblem on the desk in the middle of the room and choose to investigate it.

You'll have to solve a sliding puzzle on the desk in order to advance.  Damn 
you Alan Shepherd, always treating Alex like number 2... this sliding puzzle 
proves it.

++ SLIDING PUZZLE 3 ++

Don't worry, I've suffered through a few hours of block moving so you don't 
have to.  All you to suffer through is the text explanation.

In order to move each piece, you must highlight a piece with the right analog 
then move it in a direction with the left analog.  The B button will back you 
out of the puzzle, but it will not reset the puzzle.

NOTE: If you mess up on this puzzle then leave the Shepherd House and the 
puzzle will reset back to its default setup!

The object is to line up the insignia with the two swords on it.  If you want 
to see the insignia then go into first person view and look at the red cloth 
above the desk.  The insignia on the cloth is the same one that is on the 
puzzle.

For the puzzle sequence below, each numbered item represents the way the puzzle 
should look after the lettered directions from the prior number has been 
followed.  So after you finish with #1, then your puzzle should be arranged 
like the diagram in #2.

After solving the puzzle, the desk drawer will open up and you'll be able to 
view a ++LETTER FROM MY FATHER++.  Alex will also find a ++MAP OF SILENT 
HILL++.  The plot thickens.

Objective Updated:

[ ] Talk to Mom about Dad's letter.

Let us now exit the attic and venture down the stairs then speak with Alex's 
mother in the downstairs living room.  A cutscene will trigger on the way down 
the stairs.


_______________________ _ OTHERWORLD SHEPHERD HOUSE _ _________________________

MAJOR WARNING: This house is pure evil from a game bug/glitch point of view if 
you do something that wasn't intended for Alex to do, so be sure to save your 
game right away in the Living Room.  You might even want to keep the previous 
save outside of the house just in case.  Silent Hill's influence is more at 
work in this house then you and I will ever know, my friend!

Objective Update:

[ ] Escape the house.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT): If you solve any of the other puzzles in the Shepherd 
House BEFORE the clock puzzle then the solution for the clock puzzle might 
randomize.  The clock will have many possible solutions and there is basically 
no way that I can help you if that happens.  Some have suggested to place the 
hour hand to one number and then wind the minute hand around the clock to find 
the correct solution. The puzzle will not be unsolvable but the solution to it 
will be a random time.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT 2): After solving the puzzle in the Shepherd House, one 
of the emblems around the door will light up.  Sometimes after solving all of 
the puzzles, one of the emblems may turn dark once again.  The front door will 
usually still open, but I have read that it sometimes doesn't and you are 
forced to restart.  This is one of the few glitches that I have ran into 
myself, but it never has stopped me from completing the Shepherd House.

Alex will begin in the Otherworld version of his house after the cutscene.  A 
Schism attacked me here during my playthrough but not on my second so they're 
might be one in this room for you - it comes out of the Kitchen.  These things 
will now die with a single shotgun blast from the shotgun if you collected the 
Bluesteel shotgun.  Enter the Living Room where Mom was sitting before.

== Living Room (OW) ==

Take the ++ANGRY MASK++ from the stand on the cabinet.  There is a !!SAVE 
POINT!! to the right of the mechanism with the valve handle on it, so save your 
game.  Exit the Living Room.

NOTE: Be sure to keep this save as a backup save (make two saves) for this 
extremely evil and glitchy house.

== Front Room (OW) ==

The front door to the side cannot be opened just yet.  A puzzle must be solved 
in four areas of the house to light up a number on the four corners of the 
door.  Certain portions of the Shepherd House can now be sealed off or opened 
by pulling the lever below the staircase across from the Living Room doors.  
Don't go through the door to the Kitchen just yet, we'll save that room for 
later, so you won't have to backtrack as much.  For now, pull the lever on the 
wall two times to close the Kitchen door and open the door to Josh and Alex's 
Room upstairs.

Read the words wrote on the wall across from the lever if you want to.

"To escape to the future, you must know the past."

The words basically tell you what type of puzzles to expect in this house - 
they all relate to Alex's family.  Move up the stairs, but don't move toward 
the door to Josh and Alex's Room just yet.  Collect the ++CLEAVER++ that is 
sticking in the top of the cabinet.  Open the double doors to the right.

== Bedroom (OW) ==

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT 3): If you have been previously glitched on another 
puzzle up to this point then the stuffed rabbit might not appear in the tub.  
If this is the case, then you'll have to reload from a previous save.

Walk across the catwalk then hop over the gap to the left and enter the 
restroom.  Take the ++INDIFFERENT MASK++ from the stand on the sink.  Walk over 
to the tub and examine it to collect the ++STUFFED RABBIT++.  Hop back across 
to the bedroom entrance then exit the bedroom.  Enter Josh and Alex's Room.

== Josh and Alex's Room (OW) ==

To the immediate left, you can examine the metal tray to read a PATIENT MEMO. A 
POEM is wrote across the wall to the left.  The poem on the wall mentions the 
ticking of a clock, so examine the clock on the right wall.

The two puzzles in this room are associated with Alex and Josh.  The clock is 
the first part of the first puzzle that needs to be solved in this room and it 
is associated with Alex.

++ CLOCK PUZZLE ++

Moving the analog right and left will cycle between the two clock hands and 
moving the left analog up and down will allow you to position each clock hand.

The correct time is the time that is displayed on all clocks around Shepherd's 
Glen and it is also the room number mentioned in the Patient Memo on the metal 
tray.

SOLUTION:  2:06

What significance does 206 hold for Alex?  That is showcased as the story of 
the game unfolds... and if you paid attention to the very first cutscene of the 
game really well, then you caught a glimpse of this number.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT 4): If "206" did not work for you then you most likely 
fell victim to one of Silent Hill Homecoming's many game bugs/glitches.  The 
solution for the clock may randomize if any other puzzle is solved before it. 
Scroll back up to the beginning of this Otherworld Shepherd House section for 
the full details on this annoyance.

EXTRA INFO: I've have also received the following info for the PC version in an 
email from Ben that might be of interest to some readers:

This is how I did it. First I noticed that after finishing the other puzzles 
(Knifes, Medals, Masks), the clock somehow goes wrong. When I used my mouse to 
direct the clock hands, they won't go as I directed. For exp, I want the minute 
hand to go to 3, but it will go to 6 instead (which is 3 numbers away where I 
clicked), same for hour hand. That was very difficult to control them as we 
wanted. But the solution is you have to ignore this. Trust me, I highlighted 
the minute hand and moved it to 6 minute, it went to 25 minute instead, then I 
moved the hour hand to 2 hour, it went to 6 hour on it own will, but then the 
windows opened =)) So we've misunderstood the answer to this puzzle, it is not 
random time, it's only because there is some problem with the programming which 
made the clock hands go wrong.

I haven't played this game in PS3 or XBox360 version so I don't know the exact 
solution for those versions. Anyhow, I hope that my solution for PC version 
will help you figure out the key for the other versions (if you can imagine 
what I've mentioned above).

++ WINDOW PUZZLE ++

The windows on the side of the room will open.  Walk over to the window with 
the orange glow and examine it.  An item needs to be placed here.  This puzzle 
is connected with Josh.  Since the Robbie toy (Stuffed rabbit) is most 
associated with Josh, place the place the Stuffed Rabbit on the window.  This 
will unlock a portion of the front door on the first floor and solve the puzzle 
for this portion of the house.

Take out the Ceremonial Dagger and cut the skin wall to the right and squeeze 
through it.  Pick up the ++BUTCHER KNIFE++ from the small room inside then 
collect the --CHILD'S DRAWING (14/18)--.  Exit the room and return to the first 
floor.

== Front Room (OW) ==

Walk over to the lever and pull it once.  This will open the door to the 
basement.  Move through the nearby basement doorway then go down the stairs.

== Basement (OW) ==

Move past the large wheel off to the right then go to the back corridor.  A 
Lurker will move out from the hole in the left wall and attack near the turn. 
Hit him upside the head with the crowbar.  The door that leads to the backyard 
is wired shut.

Duck under the hole in the wire by the door.  Squeeze through the pipe on the 
back left.  Equip the Ceremonial Dagger then move around the pipe to the right 
and cut through the skin wall.  Squeeze through the room behind the wall.  Take 
the ++BOGEYMAN KNIFE++ from the hanging headless Schism.

++ KNIFE PUZZLE ++

Examine the table with the Schism head on it.  All three of the knives found in 
the house must be placed here.  Use the left analog to cycle between the knife 
holders and the Schism head.  Yes, one knife must be stuck through the Schism 
head, care to take a guess?

Place them in this order:

Butcher Knife
                          <-- tool board
               Cleaver
 _______________________
|  Bogeyman Knife       | <-- table with Schism head
 -----------------------

a) Butcher Knife is placed on the top left rack
b) Cleaver is placed on the middle right board
c) Bogeyman Knife is stuck in the Schism head

Placing the knives in the proper places will solve the puzzle for this portion 
of the house and light up a number on the front door!  Return to the front room 
up the stairs.

== Front Room (OW) ==

Pull the lever on the wall once to open the door to the kitchen.

== Kitchen (OW) --

If the Schism didn't attack Alex at the beginning of this Otherworld stage then 
it will immediately charge through the door and attack him now, so equip the 
Bluesteel shotgun and blast it once to kill it.  A Swarm will attack from in 
the kitchen.  Defeat them then collect the ++FROWNING MASK++ from the stand on 
the counter off to the left.  Grab the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the counter 
further ahead.  Another Swarm will enter the room from the hole on the north 
wall if Alex gets too close to it.  A Swarm will attack from the hole near the 
counter on the south wall if Alex examines the hole.

++ MASK PUZZLE ++

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT 5): If you place the masks on the bodies then save your 
game and reload the game then the masks might be invisible while still on the 
bodies.  You will receive an option to "Take" when Alex approaches the bodies 
but the masks will not appear in his inventory once they are taken.  This can 
really ruin the day if you placed them the wrong way and you might have to 
restart from a previous save.

Facing the door that you came through, open the door to the left of it on the 
east wall.  Walk over to the skinned bodies on the crosses - there is one on 
each side.  This puzzle is associated with Alex's mother.

Above the front body, the following message is written:

"To hide her pain, this face she did wear"

The front description describes a plain face since any of the other types of 
emotions could be a cause of pain and one can easily hide pain behind an 
expressionless face.

Above the back body, the following message is written:

"Behind this mask her heart was laid bare."

Since Alex mentions that the frowning mask reminds him of his mother, yet he 
doesn't remember seeing her this way, one would assume that she kept this 
expression to herself.  Since this side doesn't face forward it is not seen, 
thus hidden.  When Alex first picks up the angry mask, he makes no mention of 
his mother at all, which means that the angry mask is not used for this puzzle. 
If you examine the masks in the inventory menu then Alex will mention that all 
masks bear a resemblance to his mother however, which doesn't really help you 
out in solving this puzzle.

Solution: Place the Indifferent Mask on the front body and the Frowning Mask on 
the back body.

This will light up one of the numbers on the front door as well as solve the 
main puzzle for this portion of the house!

All doors back in the Kitchen are either jammed or locked.  Exit the room then 
step back into the Front Room.

== Front Room (OW) ==

Pull the lever on the wall once.  This will close the Kitchen door and open the 
door that leads to the Guest Room upstairs.  Move up the stairs and enter the 
Guest Room.

== Guest Room (OW) ==

Walk over to the metal cabinet and stand on the right side of it for a push 
command.  Take the ++HEART OF DARKNESS MEDAL++ from the floor below the metal 
cabinet.  Enter the Attic through the doorway to the side.

== Attic (OW) ==

A Schism is hiding underneath the section of the ceiling to the right as Alex 
enters this area.  Approach him cautiously then blast him with your shotgun.  
Find the narrow opening in between a metal piece and a fan that is to the left 
of the south wall fan and squeeze through it.  Move to the left behind the 
pipes and pick up the ++SHOTGUN AMMUNITION++ and ++PISTOL AMMUNITION++.  Exit 
the area by squeezing back through the narrow opening.

Facing the top of the staircase, look on the pipes to the right of it and duck 
under the opening in the pipes.  Walk over to the stand off to the right behind 
the pipes and collect the ++VILE ACTS MEDAL++.  Notice how the medal is in the 
shape of a metal pyramid.  Haha.  Right after Alex takes this medal, a Schism 
will attack from behind him, so have the shotgun ready.  Duck back under the 
pipes.

Find the narrow opening in the north and squeeze through the pipes.  A Schism 
will be lying on the floor on the other side, so take out the Crowbar and 
clobber him over the head with a charged strong swing from the back to wake him 
up then keep hitting him with an A, A, X combo to easily defeat him or you 
could just blast him once with the shotgun.  Duck under the next set of pipes 
nearby then hop over the other set further ahead.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT 6): [From a reader] When you are in the Shepard House 
in the OW in the attic, just before you enter the door to where you line the 
medals up: there is an alcove on the left hand side, the one closest to the 
door. If you go toward it and get too close, you'll get stuck there and won't 
be able to get out unless you stop the game and go back to your last saved 
point. (thanks to Jessica)

Enter the attic room off to the left and pick up the ++FALLEN STAR MEDAL++.  

++ MEDAL PUZZLE ++

Examine the coat on the rack to the left.  Use the left analog to highlight 
each medal pin where the medals will go.

If you check the medal case where the Fallen Star medal was obtained and look 
at the shapes in the case in first person view then match them up with each of 
the medals going across then you have your answer right there.  The first medal 
from left to right was the Fallen Star for sure since it was already in the 
case, the second has a heart shape and the third has a triangle shape.  Look at 
Alex's inventory and find those shapes then place them along the jacket in that 
order from left to right.

Place the medals as follows:

Fallen Star - Heart of Darkness - Vile Acts

Placing the medals properly will solve the puzzle for this portion of the 
house!

If you've been following the walkthrough for this area then all numbers on the 
front door downstairs should be lit up.  Backtrack all the way to the front 
room and move down the stairs.

== Front Room (OW) ==

You might want to save your game before exiting the house since the next save 
point in the game isn't exactly close by.  Walk over to the front door and 
rotate the valve handle.  Many cutscenes will follow.

                                                                         [WT10]
_________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ __________________________

== S. H. Dock ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Elle.

Alex will start on the shoreline of the S.H. Docks.  Walk up the wooden steps 
to the north.  You can check out the boats to the side but there is nothing in 
them.

Continue up the steps along the side of the dock.  The entire wooden dock 
structure is very unstable and creaks of the wooden boards can be heard as Alex 
moves up the steps.  Jump across to the rock platform off to the south then 
climb up to the wooden platform up above the rock.  Hop over to the platform 
with the ladder then climb the wooden ladder.  Duck under the wall to the left.

STREETS OF SILENT HILL

Alex will step out onto Sagan Street.  Move down the street to the west and a 
cutscene will trigger.  

Objective Update:

[ ] Search for a way into the prison.

An area on your map is now circled, right near Overlook Penitentiary.  Walk 
through the opening in the wall to the east and enter the Dargento Cemetery.


___________________________ _ DARGENTO CEMETERY _ _____________________________

Move down the corridor ahead.  Turn to the left and pick up the ++SAPPHIRE++ 
stone from the concrete bench.  Enter the Janus Garden to the south.

== Janus Garden ==

A Smog will likely appear off to the east, so get the handgun ready.  A statue 
of Janus lies in the middle of the Janus Garden.  Two circular indentions are 
on the statue - one on the back and one on the front.  The gates around the 
cemetery cannot be open at the moment, so there is nothing else to do in the 
cemetery for now.  Exit the cemetery the same way that Alex entered.


_________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ __________________________

Head south down Sagan Street.  You might run into a few Lurkers along the way, 
so keep the crowbar handy.  The streets ahead can have tons of respawning 
Lurkers - they move out of the gutters along the sides of the street.  Don't 
feel the need to fight them all.  If you are outnumbered, run!  Lurkers are 
actually much easier now that they can be fully seen while they are on the 
street instead of in shallow water.  Run around them and wait for them to lunge 
then simply run up to them and hit them with an A, A, X combo to stun them then 
charge an X swing to bust their head while they are stunned.

The fog is thick and some sections of the street smoke as if being badly 
burned.  There is a chilling "Welcome to Silent Hill" sign off to the east.  
Stop by the Bait Shop in the south.  Find the hole in the gate on the east side 
of the shop and duck under the hole.  Take the --PISTOL AMMO-- on the crate and 
the --CHILD'S DRAWING (15/18)-- from the wall of the Bait Shop then save your 
game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the wall to the side.

Nothing else can be done at the Bait Shop, so continue to the west along Sagan 
Street.  Move across the boards that form a bridge across the gap in the road 
to the west.  Enter Dargento Cemetery from the south entrance right after 
moving across the bridge.

___________________________ _ DARGENTO CEMETERY _ _____________________________

Walk through the entrance corridor then move to the west through the Sun 
Garden.  A Smog will appear in the Sun Garden once Alex enters the corridor to 
the west.

Right when you come to the corridor that leads out of the Sun Garden and moves 
to the west, turn to the north wall and look for a few holes in the wall then 
move against that wall until you get a "Breach" command.  Equip the Fire Axe 
and use the command to tear open the wall.  Walk over to the concrete bench to 
the right past the wall and collect the ++GARNET++ stone from the bench.  Head 
to the west and open the gate to reenter the Janus Garden.  Be sure to open the 
gate that leads to the Janus Garden on the west side of the area where you get 
the Garnet stone so that the gate will open the next time you enter from the 
north side of the garden.  The Janus statue puzzle can still not be solved at 
the moment.

Go back through the hole in the wall that Alex just made.  Walk to the south 
and examine the south gate to the Moon Garden to see that it can be opened with 
the right key.  It will be marked on your map.  Exit the Dargento Cemetery via 
the east entrance.

_________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ __________________________

Continue to the west on Sagan Street.  Walk over to the front of the Overlook 
Penitentiary to trigger a cutscene.  The front of the Penitentiary cannot be 
opened, so keep moving west.  Watch out for Lurkers as usual and head west.  
Open the door along the fence in the west.

Alex will enter the western section of Silent Hill.  Continue to the west along 
the current street.  It's useless to head to the north on Simmons Street.  You 
won't find any items there.  Run to the south and walk toward the gate labeled 
on the map to trigger a cutscene.  

Objective Update:

[ ] Disable the electric prison gate.

If you're like me, then your curiosity will get the best of you and you will 
want to touch the gate to see what will happen.  The gate is indeed electrified 
and it will fry your ass and send Alex flying back if you touch it, so don't.  
You have been warned curious reader.

You can't open the door to the Toluca Water Lake Water and Power building so 
continue to the south.  Watch for the Feral that will run at Alex once you make 
it to the car.  A Lurker might crawl out from somewhere to join the Feral so 
defeat it fast.  Run all the way to the south on Simmons Street and open the 
door to the Boiler Room.


______________________________ _ BOILER ROOM _ ________________________________

Move down the stairs and through the doorway at the bottom.  Alex will have to 
move through some knee deep shallow water.  I know, I know, and you certainly 
know what to expect as we enter this next room.  Get the Crowbar or Fire Axe 
ready.  Enter the Basement Boiler Room in the west.

== Basement Boiler Room ==

As Alex heads to the north, a Lurker will attack from near the middle of the 
room.  Collect the --HEALTH DRINK-- from off the metal structure near the two 
boilers in the north.  Move up the stairs in the west and open the door at the 
top of the stairs.

_________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ __________________________

Alex will exit the Boiler Room from the west side and step out into an alley. 
Walk out onto Koontz Street then head east.  Stay on the south side of the 
street and pick up the --RIFLE AMMUNTION-- from the window ceil of the Boiler 
Room right before the west barricade.  Alex don't have the rifle yet, but this 
will come in handy later.  Go back to the west.

Move toward Alchemilla Hospital and run through the gates on the east side to 
find the ++BLOODSTONE++ on the east side platform below a fenced portion of the 
wall.  Keep heading to the west then walk through the open gate in the middle 
portion of Alchemilla Hospital and find the medical case on the west bench that 
contains a --SERUM (6/8)--.  Exit the area.

Run back to the east on Koontz Street then go north on Wilson Street.  There is 
a section of the fence missing near the Toluca Lake Water and Power building 
but you can't open the door on the building or find any item inside the area.  
Go to the far north and find the Toluca Lake Offices.  A Feral is feasting on a 
corpse in the middle of the street to the north, so arm your Ceremonial Dagger 
then rush him and kill him while no other Lurkers are on the street to take him 
down safely.  For an interesting sight along the way, look toward the Church on 
the west side of Wilson Street.  The church doors are locked.  Notice the 
sirens on the top portion of the church much like the sirens in the Silent Hill 
movie.  Christabella and her followers would be proud!

Enter the Toluca Lake Offices by opening the door on the south side of the 
building.


__________________________ _ TOLUCA LAKE OFFICES _ ____________________________

== Reception ==

You might want to examine the OLD NEWSPAPER on the second left desk.  Pick up 
the --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from off the right set of shelves near the door.  All 
three of the doors in the left hallway cannot be opened so open the door in the 
north portion of the reception area.

== Lower Landing ==

The door to the right requires a key.  Go ahead and examine it to label it on 
your map.  Move through the doorway to the west and continue down the corridor. 
The doors along the way cannot be opened.

== Office ==

There is a very well hidden ++TURQUOISE++ stone in the sink off to the right 
after entering this room - be sure to look for it since it is required to solve 
the puzzle in the cemetery.  Collect the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the right desk. 
Save your game at the typewrite... oh, I'm sorry, wrong game. Haha.  Walk over 
to the large opening in the side of the wall on the west side of the office 
then jump over to the Break Room via the jump command.

== Break Room ==

Save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the east wall of the Break Room.  Equip 
the Fire Axe and chop through the boards to the northeast then enter the 
Kitchen behind the doorway and pick up the ++TOLUCA LAKE WATER AND POWER KEY++ 
from off the counter to the right.  All the doors in the room cannot be opened. 
Backtrack to the Break Room then hop back across to the Office.

== Office ==

Move back down the hall to the east and enter the Lower Landing again.

== Lower Landing ==

Use the key on the east door to unlock the door.  Open it and then open the 
door down the stairs to gain entry to the Toluca Lake Water and Power building


__________________ _ TOLUCA LAKE WATER AND POWER BUILDING _ ___________________

Objective Update

== Power Room ==

[ ] Shut down the power generator.

It sure is loud in this room isn't it!  Move around the corner and a new enemy 
will attack - Order members!  Take out the shotgun or the Fire Axe and attack 
them as they rush at Alex from the south.  One will move down a ladder in the 
west and the other will run at Alex from the east.  Sometimes they don't see 
Alex when you first enter the area, so look up on the second floor - they'll 
eventually spot Alex.

Like fighting Schisms its hard to fight them in groups, so use the shotgun to 
defeat the first Order member then use a melee weapon on the other.  The melee 
weapon that you use really doesn't matter much, but I'd recommend the 
Ceremonial Dagger or Crowbar.  A, A, A, X swings work well with the dagger and 
A, A, X swings work well with the Crowbar.  Their attacks aren't really aren't 
that hard to dodge since you can actually see warning signs before they swing. 
They are much like fighting Alex himself since they have the same moves as him 
and can even dodge your attacks.  It's really up to you how you want to fight 
them.  The worst part about these enemies is that they can dodge like Alex, but 
usually continuing a combo once they dodge to the side will hit them as the 
stop.  Also, the radio will not tell you when they are around, so you'll have 
to listen for their footsteps.  Defeating the first Order member will give you 
an achievement.

-----
Achievement unlocked:

-> Out of Order (10G)

Examine the DIAGRAM on the white board in the north.

A = Water feed
B = Boiler
C = Steam feed

Don't rotate the valve handle with the A above it on the west wall to turn off 
the water feed yet.  All of the valves have to be rotated in a certain order.  
The order can be found in a posted note on the second floor.  Pull up to the 
higher area near the part where some stairs used to be or the part without 
railing then run to the southeast portion of this room and pick up the --PISTOL 
AMMUNITION-- from the shelf if needed.

Climb up either of the ladders.  Pick up the --FIRST AID KIT-- off the 
northwest wall near the turbine and grab the --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- and other 
--RIFLE AMMUNITION-- pickup from the shelf outside of the Foreman's Office.  
Examine the NOTICE on the second floor wall outside of the Foreman's Office.  
This will tell you that you need to turn off the valves in a certain order 
starting with the one that controls the boilers.

++ VALVE PUZZLE ++

Valve B controls the boilers so run over to the side of the long turbine and 
rotate the valve to turn off the boilers.  Rotate Valve A on the first floor 
next then rotate Valve C.  Long story short, here is the order:

B = Boiler
A = Water feed
C = Steam feed

Once Valve C is rotated, the green light on the main controls on the second 
floor will light up, so move over to the controls on the east side of the 
second floor and pull the lever on them to shut off the power and end the 
horrible racket in this room.  A cutscene will play once the power is shut 
down.

Objective Update:

[ ] Return to the prison.

Now all is dark and fairly quiet.  I would highly advise you to wait on the 
second floor, since some pitter patter of boots can be heard on the first 
floor.  Two Order members will move up the ladder and attack - one of them has 
an assault rifle.  Use the shotgun to take down at least one of them then deal 
with the other.  Sometimes the Order member with the assault rifle will wait on 
the bottom floor and shoot at Alex, so you might have to climb down the ladder 
to fight him.  Climb or drop down to the first floor then exit via door that 
Alex used to enter this room.

Backtrack to the Break Room and save your game!  The streets outside are no 
longer as friendly as they were.  Exit the building through the Reception area.

_________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ __________________________

The streets are now dark and other enemies have surfaced to take the place of 
the Lurkers.  Now you will run into Ferals and Schisms on the streets of Silent 
Hill.  Make your way to the east door of the Boiler Room and run fast without 
getting into fights!  There is no time for sight seeing this time, unless you 
are really that good at handling Ferals and Schisms together!  I have checked 
this section over again and couldn't find any new items lying around.


______________________________ _ BOILER ROOM _ ________________________________

Well, you know what to look out for here.  The highly expected Lurker will 
appear near the southeast end of the basement boiler room.  Move down into the 
knee deep water then prepare to fight the Lurker and exit out to the streets 
again in the northeast.

_________________________ _ STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ __________________________

No enemies will attack on these dark streets, well most of the way.  Travel to 
the north on Simmons Street then make your way to the gate of the Overlook 
Penitentiary.  A Siam will bust right through the gate, so take out your 
shotgun or handgun and blast it to finish it - with how distant it is when it 
appears, the handgun really works better.  Enter the area beyond the gate and 
pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from off the garbage dumpster to the left of the 
two door on the west side of the building and pick up the ++PULASKI AXE++ from 
inside the back of the truck near the south side of this area.

If you want an extra item (an extra weapon - the assault rifle) from the 
Dargento Cemetery then return to the east side of Silent Hill via the door on 
the east side of Sagan Street right now.  Once you enter the Penitentiary, you 
are stuck there until completion of the Penitentiary.  This is your only chance 
to get this weapon, so get it now.

The east side of Silent Hill is still lit up and only has Lurker enemies 
roaming the streets.  Enter the Dargento Cemetery through the south entrance 
then run all the way back to Janus Garden.

++ STATUE/STONE PUZZLE ++ (Optional)

Two of four stones that Alex has must be placed into the circular slots of the 
statue of Janus.  Notice that the statue has "XII" on the front of it and a "I" 
on the back of it above each slot.  If you examine the stones that Alex has, 
they all have dates on them for the birth month that they represent.  The 
numbers on the statue refer to the correct month for each of the two stones 
that it needs.  You need the birthstone for December and January.

Place the Turquoise stone in the front circular slot of the statue and place 
the Garnet stone in the back circular slot of the statue.  The ++MOON GARDEN 
KEY++ will fall out from the opening on the right side of the statue.  Find the 
Moon Garden gate on your map then go there and unlock the gate with the Moon 
Garden Key.

A Smog will attack in the Moon Garden.  Defeat him then walk over to the 
mausoleum that he was standing near.  There is a crack in the wall near a pool 
of blood and there is a weapon slightly visible under the crack in the wall of 
the mausoleum.  Grab the ++M14 ASSAULT RIFLE++ from the crack.  You'll get an 
achievement for picking this up.

Return to the west side of Silent Hill and continue at the Penitentiary where I 
left off.

Go through the west gate of Penitentiary again.  Pick up the health drink on 
top of the dumpster near the two locked doors and Pulaski Axe from the back of 
the truck if you haven't yet.  Move to the north around the west side of the 
Penitentiary building and open the entrance door in the north.

                                                                         [WT11]

== Visitor Security ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Elle.

A !!SAVE POINT!! is on the wall to the left as Alex begins in the Penitentiary. 
Move forward past the reception counter for a cutscene.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Wheeler.

It seems that Wheeler is in Cellblock B.  Unfortunately dear ole' dad didn't 
leave his son a copy of the Penitentiary map, so we'll have to find one to 
figure out where Cellblock B is.  Open the door around the opposite side of the 
reception.

== Guard Room ==

Wow, torsos with blood trails and meaty chunks aren't a good introductions to a 
prison area in Silent Hill.  Let's see what's around the right corner.  Open 
the door to the office.  Pull the lever on the wall inside the office to open 
the outside gate.  Walk back out of the office and move through the open gate.

== Visitor Area ==

The gate will close behind Alex.  The lever on this side that opens the gate is 
broken so Alex is stuck in this area now.  Well, damn.  Equip the Pulaski Axe 
and chop through the boards covering the nearby doorway.  Walk inside and pick 
up the --FIRST AID KIT-- from the next to the last back counter.

Move further down the hall back outside the room.  Another gate bars your way 
around the left corner.  The lever to the right is broken, so turn to the 
cracked glass on the left wall and give the command to break the glass.  Hop 
through the opening in the wall.  Examine the PRISONER NOTE near the middle of 
the counters.  Open the door up ahead.

== Security Area ==

Turn to the right after moving through the doorway then open the double doors 
nearby and pick up the --PISTOL AMMO-- off the shelf near the shut gate.  Go 
back into the room you were in.  Examine the WORKER'S NOTE on the vehicle.  
Pick up the ++PRISON MAP++ on the wall across from the bottom of the stairs.  
Open the door on the south side of the room and enter the storage room then 
pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the shelf directly ahead.  Reenter the big 
room and move up the stairs.

You'll hear a variety of noises while moving across the top catwalk.  Make your 
way over to the gap in the catwalk and jump across the gap.  The gate up ahead 
leads to Cellblock B but it is sealed off.  Open the door on the right.

Examine the row of monitors to see a familiar face.  You can't use the door 
controls on the right side of the room.  Pull the lever on the left to open the 
gate outside that goes to Cellblock B.  Exit the room then step into the 
Cellblock B corridor.

== B Block (South) ==

Two figures can be seen up ahead as Alex walks down the hall.  No, it's not 
Wheeler and Elle.  These are two Order members.  They will notice Alex soon so 
prepare to defeat them.  I recommend using a gun on at least one of them so you 
can focus on defeating the other with a melee weapon.  You can try to go for 
headshots to take more damage from them while they have their backs turned.  
Enter the first cell off to the left and examine the OLD NEWSPAPER.  All of the 
open cells have several messages wrote across the walls inside - you can see 
them better in first person view (RS).

If you open the door to the west, you'll only be greeted with a fence that 
seals off the rest of B Block, so pull the lever on the right wall in the 
current B Block area to open the north gate.  Move through the open gate then 
take the staircase down.  The staircase will take Alex to Cell Wing B.

== Cell Wing B (East) ==

Pick up the --RIFLE AMMUNITION-- from the shelf in the open hallway on the left 
and walk into the next to last cell on the right then examine the LETTER FROM A 
PRISONER on the bed.  Open the double doors on the west side.

== Hallway in between B Block ==

The middle area is blocked so open the door to the north.

== Cell Wing B (North) ==

Right when Alex opens the door, two Order members will attack, so backtrack 
into the hall then take one of them down with a gun and fight the other with a 
melee weapon.  Reenter the Cell Wing B North after fighting the Order members.

Deputy Wheeler is locked inside of Cell B11.  The tables have turned Mr. 
Wheeler!  Find the working lever on the east wall then pull it to open 
Wheeler's cell and trigger a cutscene.

Objective Update:

[ ] Escort Wheeler to safety.

A Siam will attack directly after the cutscene.  It attacks Wheeler, leaving 
its weak side open to Alex, so take out your most powerful gun and shoot at its 
back to quickly defeat it.  The Assault Rifle works incredibly well for a Siam 
since it will stagger it slightly after each shot.  Wheeler can really help out 
for this fight, so you might actually want to let him damage the Siam for the 
most part.  The Siam attacks him as soon as it appears anyway.

Wheeler will punch in the code on the control panel on the west staircase after 
the Siam is defeated.  The entrance doors have been sealed off by a fallen 
catwalk and the door to the supply closet is locked, so follow Wheeler up the 
stairs of the west staircase.

== B Block (North) ==

Wheeler will lead the way, but don't be so quick to follow.  Enter the Upper 
Guard Room and pick up the --CHILD'S DRAWING (16/18)-- from the side of the 
damaged wall.

Walk back out of the Upper Guard Room then hop over the large gap in the 
catwalks to the left to join up with Wheeler.  There is nothing in the cell to 
the left so duck under the wall to join up with Wheeler.

== B Block Office ==

Do as Wheeler says and pull the lever.  The door to the side will open and 
Wheeler will rush through it and unlock the gate to the east then enter the 
east portion of B Block.  Follow Wheeler into B Block east.

== B Block East ==

Follow Wheeler directly ahead to the east.  He will move into the big room with 
the staircase then step into the side office to the north.

A slight cutscene will play in the office.  Wheeler will unlock the gate to 
Block A in the north, so hop across the gap in the catwalk to the east then 
move in front of the gate to A Block.  Wheeler will contact Alex then unlock 
the gate for him.  Move on ahead and open the door.

== A Block (South) ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Elle.

Examine the kindly LETTER FROM A PRISONER on the bed in the first cell.  Take 
the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the sink in the second cell (A6).  Find the PRISONER 
LETTER posted on the right wall of the last cell.  Exit through the double 
doors to the north.

== Hallway Between A Block ==

Wheeler will contact Alex and tell him to wait a moment so he can get the gate 
open.  The gate will begin to open then it will short circuit.  Wheeler will 
tell Alex to find another way to the rest of A Block.  Step back into A block 
to the south.

== Block A (South) ==

Wheeler will contact Alex again and mention that he found another route.  He 
will open the gate to the East Staircase then tell Alex to move down them.

== East Staircase ==

Move down the stairs and walk up to the gate at the bottom.  Wheeler will 
contact Alex then open the gate to the Cell Wing A.

== Cell Wing A ==

The door to the left side is jammed.  Walk to the south of Cell Wing A and 
Wheeler will eventually contact Alex and mention that he is breaking up.  A 
Needler will step out of the cell in the south and attack.  Equip the Pulaski 
Axe and fight it off while you dodge its attacks.  The cell that he comes from 
has a blood trail leading to it but there is nothing inside besides a hole in 
the wall where the Needler entered the cell.  The gate to the shower area on 
the west side will open eventually.

== Shower Area ==

Walk through the open rooms and enter the shower room ahead.  The radio will 
begin to go off once Alex enter the middle of the shower area and two Needlers 
will attack.  Use the Pulaski Axe to defeat both of them.  Alex can destroy the 
walls along the side of each shower portion - it's slightly amusing.  Continue 
to the south of the shower room.

A light will showcase a damaged portion of the wall with a few holes in it on 
the west wall.  Equip the Pulaski Axe then walk over to the weak wall and knock 
it down with the breach command.  Squeeze through the pipes along the wall that 
Alex just broke through.

== Boiler Room ==

Open the door to the north.

== Corridor to A Block (West) ==

The bottom gate in the next room is sealed.  Move up the stairs.  Save your 
game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the east wall at the top of the stairs.

*******************************************************************************
IMPORTANT:

This is your last save point before the fist decision further ahead that will 
affect the ending that you receive.  You might want to save this file to 
another slot and keep it there, separate from the current one, since you can 
always start from this section of the game to get the other endings if you load 
up this save later on.  There is no need to play through the game multiple 
times to obtain all endings.

*******************************************************************************

Open the double doors to the north.  Follow the corridor to the north.  Try to 
open the door at the end.  It is jammed.  Alex will contact Wheeler and tell 
him about the situation then Wheeler will mention that he should backtrack.  
Reenter the hallway to the south and move down the stairs.  Don't go through 
the door to the south again - turn to the left and walk up to the sliding gate 
to the north.

== Corridor To Cell Wing A (West) ==

The room to the left is completely blocked off, so open the double doors to the 
north.  Continue to the north then open the door at the end on the east side of 
the hall.

== Cell Wing A (West) ==

Duck under the fallen catwalk to the left to enter the first cell on the left 
then squeeze through the narrow hole in the east wall of the cell.  Examine the 
front portion of the vehicle that has crashed into the cell door.  Alex will 
take the ++LOOSE WIRE++ from the headlight.  Squeeze back through the opening 
in the cell wall then duck back under the fallen catwalk to get out.  

If you go through the double doors in the east then Alex will run across a 
keypad that is not receiving power.  He will contact Wheeler about it.  You 
need to go up to the second floor of Cell Wing A to reroute the power.  Move up 
the staircase beside the cell that Alex had to duck under to reach the top 
portion of the room.

== A Block (West) ==

Grab the --HEALTH DRINK-- off the shelf to the left after reaching the top of 
the stairs.  Jump across the gap to the south then enter the Upper Guard Room 
(with the damaged wall).  Walk over to the fuse box in the back of the cell.  
It's missing three wires and we have one, so we'll need to search for the other 
two.  Walk into the cell beside the Upper Guard Room.

Examine the radio then Alex will pick up the ++RADIO WIRE++ on top of it.  The 
next two cells have nothing in them.  Open the double doors to the east 
hallway.  Enter the office in the hall then examine the case of tools and Alex 
will take the ++SCRAP OF WIRE++.

We now have all three wires, so go back into Block A (West) and move over to 
the fuse box in the Upper Guard Room.

++ FUSE PUZZLE 2 ++

Cycle through your inventory and place all three wires onto the fuse box - 
Loose Wire, Scrap of Wire, Radio Wire.  This puzzle is just like the power box 
puzzle outside of the Grand Hotel.

Here is the solution:

W = White, G = Green, Y = Yellow, B = Blue, R = Red

W  G  Y  B  R
O  O  O  O  O

O  O  O  O  O
R  W  G  B  Y

Pull the second lever to the left once power has been restored.  This will open 
Cell A15 in the northeast.  Run to east on the outside catwalk then face Cell 
A15 and jump over to it by using the jump command that appears while facing it. 
Pick up the --SERUM (7/8)-- from the shelf in the cell.  Jump back across to 
the catwalk.  Simply drop down the middle portion without railing on the 
catwalk outside to reach the bottom floor again.

There are two working levers on the southwest wall outside of the Supply 
Closet.  Pull the right lever to open Cell A14 and pull the left lever to open 
Cell A12.  Cell A14 does not contain anything but Cell A12 has a PRISONER NOTE 
on the far wall inside with a number wrote on it: "110391".

++ KEYPAD PUZZLE 2 ++

Open the double doors to the east then examine the keypad on the north wall.  
The correct code is the number on the Prisoner Note from Cell A12.

** 110391 **

The door will unlock after entering the code above, so open it.

== Solitary Confinement ==

Move down the stairs then head to the southeast along the corridor.  Alex will 
contact Wheeler as he walks further down the hall.  The first two doors are 
sealed.  There is a person tied to a cross up ahead.  A cutscene will play as 
Alex walks toward the cross.

_______________________ _ OVERLOOK PENITENTIARY (OW) _ ________________________

== Solitary Confinement (OW) ==

The surroundings will quickly change to Otherworld during the cutscene and Alex 
will begin in Otherworld once you take control of him again.  None of the doors 
around this area will open.  The ceiling behind Alex drips with blood as Alex 
makes his way back to the entrance of this area.  Leave the area and step 
outside.

Save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the nearby fence to the left.  Open the 
double doors to the side then walk into the big room ahead.  A cutscene will 
trigger and a pillar will rise out of the middle portion of the room.  Walk 
toward the pillar.  DO NOT reach inside when prompted.  If Alex reaches inside 
right now then you'll have to tap a button to make Alex pull his hand back as 
he is damaged.  Afterwards a Needler will fall from the ceiling and attack 
Alex.

++ RIDDLE PUZZLE ++

Read the three signs around the room.

- Left Sign

I stand beside the holy man
The monarch fear my wrath
None may move the way I can
Ever the crooked path

- Middle Sign

The man who devised it
Does not want it
The man who brought it
Does not use it
The man who used it
Does not realize it

- Right Sign

What man loves more than life
Fears more than death or mortal strife
What poor men have, the rich acquire
And all contended men desire
What Misers spend and the Wastrels save
And each man carries to his grave

The three signs all have riddles that give clues to the correct symbol on the 
dial on each of the sides of the pillars across from them.  Examine the dials 
and rotate them with the left analog, so that the correct symbol is displayed 
on the top portion of each of them.

Solution:

Left = Knight (horse head)
Middle = Coffin (with cross)
Right = Nothing (empty space)

Once the dials are all aligned properly, reach inside of the pillar from the 
front side of the pillar along the east side.  Alex will actually kill the worm 
in the middle of the pillar by reaching inside after the correct sequence is 
displayed on the side dials.  Walk toward the hole in the middle of the room 
after the cutscene plays.

This is your hole Alex.  Won't you jump in?  Jump into the hole.  A cutscene 
will play when Alex lands.

== Shower Area (OW) ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Elle.

Both Alex and Deputy Wheeler will face the south end of this room.  If you turn 
to the east, you'll be able to see a !!SAVE POINT!! glowing on the far wall.  I 
don't know about you, but I'm going to save my game.  Neither of the doors will 
open in this area, so find the narrow opening in the wall on the southwest side 
and squeeze through the opening.

== Boiler Room (OW) ==

Open the door to the north and move up the staircase ahead.

== Outside Corridor (OW) ==

Move along the walkway with the electrical cables lying along the floor.  Alex 
can't turn the valve handle in the middle so keep moving to the northwest.  
Step through the doorway at the end then go down the stairs.

Human screams can be heard as Alex and Wheeler continue to the east down the 
next corridor.  Walk through the doorway at the end.

A cutscene will play as two Needlers move out from the hole in the ceiling.  
You can easily distract the Needlers with a melee weapon while Wheeler shoots 
them.  Walk through the doorway on the east side and step out into the next 
corridor ahead.

Move to the east along the next corridor.  Step into the smaller corridor at 
the end then move into the room off to the left.  Grab the --HEALTH DRINK-- 
from the shelf to the right and the --FIRST AID KIT-- from the shelf on the 
left then save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!!.  Run back outside and rotate 
the valve handle on the east door to open it.  A cutscene will trigger in the 
next room.

== Gas Chamber (OW) ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Defeat Asphyxia

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Boss - Asphyxia

Wow.  Pretty cool design for a boss, I must say!

Kind of like the last boss, you'll need to learn this boss' attacks before you 
can fight it appropriately.  Dodging is highly needed in this battle.

Three Hit Combo - Asphyxia swings its arms forward two times then ends the 
combo with an uppercut.  It does this move usually only at the beginning of the 
battle while you're in close range.

Punch and Tail Whip - Asphyxia holds up her back tail and shakes it then swings 
its arm and then turns and whips its tail.

Black Vomit - Asphyxia spits up black liquid then vomits forward a steam of 
black liquid in front of it.

Grab - Asphyxia leans back a bit then lunges forward with a grab.

All of Asphyxia's attacks need some well timed button pressing in order to 
dodge them.  As it punches three time in a row, you'll have to dodge each swing 
by tapping the dodge button right before each attack.  It only does this move 
at the beginning of the battle usually.  When it shakes its tail and swings its 
arm forward, press the dodge button and Alex will dodge the swing and 
automatically dodge the tail.  When it pukes up black liquid quickly press the 
dodge button to make Alex roll backward - don't press a direction during this 
dodge or Alex will not dodge the move.  When it leans back and prepares to 
lunge, keep pressing the dodge button while holding to the right or left and 
Alex will eventually jump out of the way of the attack.  This dodge really has 
to be timed like all the other dodges but sometimes simply tapping the dodge 
button while holding in one direction will allow Alex to dodge it as well.  
Make sure you hold either to the right or left while tapping the dodge button 
or Alex will get grabbed!

A melee weapon works fine for attacking it but only attack it after dodging a 
swing or especially after dodging its lunge.  Alex will land right behind it 
after dodging a lunge and will be able to hit its back tail and stun the 
creature.  Dodging its lunge and getting in the back of it for a few hits is 
the main key to winning this battle easily.  Once it is stunned from hitting 
its tail, run to the front of it and perform a combo ending with a charged 
strong swing with the Pulaski Axe for some major damage.  If it grabs Alex with 
its lunge then it will hold him up, so tap the corresponding button that 
appears to struggle free and hit it in the process.

Once the button icon appears over its head, press the X button while the icon 
appears while standing near it to finish it off.  Surprisingly, this boss will 
be finished after the first finishing blow unlike the rest up till now.  You'll 
gain an achievement after defeating Asphyxia.

Objective Update:

[ ] Follow Joshua.

A cutscene will play after the battle.  You will regain control of Alex in the 
same room where he finished Asphyxia after the cutscene.  Walk over to the 
shattered glass that broke from Asphyxia's dying scream and hop through the 
glass.

Run along the catwalk then open the door to the northeast.  You can examine the 
NOTICE on the right wall of the next room.  Open the next door.


____________________ _ OTHERWORLD STREETS OF SILENT HILL _ ____________________

Run toward Josh up ahead.  After Josh does the usual "I'll run, you follow" 
type dash, move to the far left side of this area and pick up the --PISTOL 
AMMUNITION-- and other --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from the ground.  A Smog will 
attack eventually, so take out the handgun and aim for its glowing lungs when 
it attacks.  Run the way that Josh went.

The only door up ahead is jammed.  Find the valve handle along the far wall to 
the right of the gate up ahead and rotate it to make the gate to the left slide 
open.  Move past the opening where the gate was and make an immediate right 
then pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- on the floor behind the small building.  
Continue ahead and shoot the Smog that attacks.  Along the right side of the 
stairs up ahead, pick up the --RIFLE AMMUNITION--.  Move up the stairs and open 
the doors to the church.

                                                                         [WT12]
___________________________ _ OTHERWORLD CHURCH _ _____________________________

== Main Hall ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Search the church for anything helpful.

The entrance to Alex's back is now suddenly sealed by barbed wire.  This looks 
like something taken right out of horror movie, doesn't it?  Wait.

Take the ++CHURCH MAP++ from the first bench off to the right as you move 
ahead.  Move directly toward the back of the church and examine the FEW LINES 
FROM A HYMN on the right bench in the middle of the church then find the 
--SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- off to the right near the last bench.

Examine the pentagonal design of the wall in the middle directly to the south 
(the organ).  It seems that Alex can use his Ceremonial Dagger here, so equip 
the dagger then use it on the pentagon.  With a horrid screech, the gate in the 
East Wing will open.  The pentagon can be examined again.  It requires five 
plates to be set inside of each prong along the pentagon design.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find the pieces missing from the five prongs.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT): Do not try to place the plates on the pentagonal 
design early or they may become invisible while they remain in place.  A reader 
emailed me about how the plates turn invisible yet they still remain in place 
after the person had placed the plates while continuing his exploration of the 
church.  The option to "Take" will appear, but they will not appear in Alex's 
inventory.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT 2): If you save while Alex has multiple plates that can 
be found in the Church in his inventory, you run the risk of having one of them 
change into another plate for duplicate copies of the same plate!  One reader 
emailed me about having two tree plates; his kneeling man changed into a tree 
plate.  Be sure to keep one save outside of the Church, or before picking up 
any plates to avoid this possible glitch.

Go to the East Wing.  A Schism will attack along the way, so take out your 
shotgun and blast it.  Run back toward the entrance then head east and duck 
under the benches on that side.  Sounds of scampering bugs can be heard along 
the way into the East Wing.

== East Wing ==

NOTE: You might want to go directly up the stairs right now and save your game 
then make a backup save (two saves) since this Church can be just as glitchy as 
the Otherworld version of the Shepherd House.  The evil of Silent Hill knows no 
bounds!

Walk toward the bowl (basin) next to the mirror off to the right after stepping 
past the gate and pick up the --PHOTO (11/11)--.  If you've been following this 
guide, then this photo will be the last photo.  Obtaining all photos will 
extend the ending of the game with an extra scene after the closing credits.  
Also, you, my friend, will receive an achievement for gathering all of the 
photos!

The low cage (baptismal font) up ahead can be examined.  Alex needs to find 
some way to move it.  Walk over to the back of the right wall and rotate the 
valve handle on that wall.  The Swarm inside of the caged area will attack Alex 
as soon as the valve handle is rotated, so get ready to squash some bugs.  Take 
the ++CHALICE PLATE++ from the top of the body in the pool of blood inside of 
the open caged area.  Move up the stairs past the open gate to the west.

A !!SAVE POINT!! can be seen on the wall directly ahead.  View the EXCERPT FROM 
A PSALM on the table to the left.  Walk over to the confession booth and 
examine it.  There is someone inside!  Save your game before talking with the 
person.  This particular conversation will help to decide what ending you will 
get.

The man will also leave behind the ++KNEELING MAN PLATE++ in the confession 
booth as a gift no matter what is chosen, so be sure to pick it up.  Enter the 
area past the open gate and pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- from the floor to the 
right.  Examine the unlit candle on the left table then Alex will take the 
++UNLIT CANDLE++.  

Nothing else can be done here since the hallway to the west is blocked off by a 
hole in the floor with leaning boards around it, so run all the way back down 
the stairs and enter the Main Hall once again.  Two Schisms will attack in the 
Main Hall, so have the shotgun ready.  Run over toward the West Wing and duck 
up under the benches.  Move through the gate down the stairs.

== West Wing ==

Walk toward the statue up ahead.  Pick up the --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from off 
the floor on the left side of the statue.  The statue is holding an object.  
There is a candle holder below the statue.  Place the Unlit Candle in the 
candle holder.  The statue's arms will separate and Alex will gain the ++CANDLE 
PLATE++.

Walk through the gate on the left (east) side of the room and move up the 
stairs.  A small cutscene will play halfway up the stairs.  Pick up the --
HEALTH DRINK-- from the table off to the right as Alex reaches the top of the 
stairs.  There is some --SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- on the other side of the benches. 
The gate to the south cannot be opened.

Examine the three paintings on the west wall.  All of them may be cut with the 
Ceremonial Dagger.  The painting of the woman has nothing behind it.  A Swarm 
will attack Alex if you cut the picture of the dying tree.  Cut the picture of 
the man being restrained by roots and take the ++TREE PLATE++ from behind the 
wall indention behind the painting.

Once the Tree Plate has been taken, a Schism will bust through the gate to the 
south.  Have your shotgun ready to blast him.  Enter the hall beyond the gate 
and pick up the --RIFLE AMMUNTION-- from the floor to the right.  Move down the 
hall to the east and look to the right to see a --FIRST AID KIT-- on the first 
desk.  Walk over to the glass tiles against the south wall in between the desks 
then examine them to view the scene on the window glass.  Have Alex's Assault 
Rifle equipped before grabbing the next plate.  Take the ++SWORD PLATE++ from 
below the painting of the knight.  Right after the Sword Plate has been taken, 
a cutscene will trigger.

== Main Hall ==

Alex will be face to face against two Siams while in the south portion of the 
Main Hall after the cutscene.  Take out the Assault Rifle (preferably) or the 
Shotgun.  The Assault Rifle works incredibly well once you get to a distance 
away from them since each shot will make the targeted Siam pause as it moves 
toward Alex.  With the Assault Rifle, you can easily defeat one of them right 
when they first rush Alex if you aim quick enough and fire fast enough.  Make 
sure that you roll a bunch and distance Alex from the Siams before attempting 
to shoot them.  This can be a very deadly battle if you allow them to pin Alex 
into a corner.

++ SLOT PUZZLE ++

The entrance to the north portion of the Main Hall is now sealed off, so Alex 
can't backtrack to the East or West Wing now.  Turn your attention to the 
pentagon design on the north wall.  You should have the following plates:

Kneeling Man Plate
Candle Plate
Chalice Plate
Tree Plate
Sword Plate

The Chalice Plate was obtained from the baptismal font which has a body inside 
and was bathed in blood, which resembles an offering or sacrifice.  The 
Kneeling Man Plate was take from the person in the confession booth that 
confessed his sins to Alex to resemble penitence.  The Candle Plate was taken 
from the statue whose expression was said to be full of sadness to resemble 
sorrow.  The Tree Plate was obtained from the behind the paining of the man 
restrained to a tree while he had his eyes fixed on the woman in the first 
painting, which resembles desire.  The Sword Plate was taken from below the 
image of a knight that was being stabbed in the back by an executioner, which 
resembles vengeance.

Examine the pentagon design and place the plates onto the grooves as follows:

Penitence = Kneeling Man Plate
Vengeance = Sword Plate
Desire = Tree Plate
Sorrow = Candle Plate
Sacrifice = Chalice Plate

Once the plates have all been placed into the slots correctly a cutscene will 
play as the organ wall folds away.  Walk toward the person up ahead and a 
cutscene will play.

Objective Update:

[ ] Follow the monster.

Alex will receive the ++SHEPHERD FAMILY RING++ after the cutscene.  Move 
through the remains up ahead.  Right after stepping to the other side of the 
wooden torture device, look to the left and pick up the --CHILD'S DRAWING 
(17/18)-- from the back of the crate under the torture device.  Grab the --
HEALTH DRINK-- from the floor to the right.

The entrance doorway to the stairs will seal off as Alex gets on the staircase. 
Run down the stairs, Mr. Sunderland.  Down and down and down and down and... 
Hey, there is a bottom!

== Mine Tunnel ==

Objective Update:

[ ] I have to find something that will protect me from the steam.

Barbed wire will seal off the stairway as Alex steps into the this tunnel.  
Don't try to go through the steam that is spraying out of the pipes to the 
right or Alex will get badly damaged on his way through the steam.  Turn left 
and move ahead until a desk comes into view.  Examine the items on the desk.  
Alex will equip the ++MINING GEAR++ you examine it on the desk, so be sure to 
do so.  There is nothing else on this side.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find out where the monster went.

Run to the other side and move through the steam vapors.  The steam will not 
damage Alex as long as he wears the mining suit.  Move toward the metal 
elevator door up ahead then press the button on the beam to the right of the 
door.  Many cutscenes will play after pressing the button.

Don't sit down the controller during the cutscene while Alex is strapped in the 
chair since you will need to tap the buttons labeled on the screen rapidly in 
order to help Alex during the final two cutscenes.

WARNING (GAME BUG ALERT): Do NOT skip any of these cutscenes or your game will 
freeze.  A black screen will appear and stay there and you'll have to turn your 
console off to get it to play again.  The game messes up because of the 
interactive cutscene that follows the normal cutscene.  If you allow the 
cutscenes to play normally then you won't have a problem.  Yeah, it sucks 
during a repeated runthrough but just bare with the lengthy cutscene and you'll 
avoid having to turn off your console.

                                                                         [WT13]

== Torture Room ==

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Elle.

Wow.  A lot has happened!  Turn around once Alex is free.  Pick up the --FIRST 
AID KIT--, ++CEREMONIAL DAGGER++, --HEALTH DRINK-- and ++LAIR MAP++ from the 
counters behind Alex then save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on east wall.  
Be sure to turn on Alex's flashlight and arm the Ceremonial Dagger.  Open the 
door to the north.

== Hallway Outside Torture Room ==

Move down the corridor.  The first door to the right is locked.  The door down 
the right corridor past the bars is locked and requires a key.  Continue to the 
north then head west along the hall.  It's useless to open the door to the 
north that leads to the second hallway since you'll need a partner to help with 
rotating the valve handle and raising the gate at the east end of that hall.

Open the door to Room 212.  An Order member will see Alex and attack him, so 
step back out into the hall and defeat him with the Ceremonial Dagger.  It's 
not that hard to take him down with just the dagger since he is alone after 
all.  Enter Room 212.

== Room 212 ==

Take the ++STEEL PIPE++ that is sticking through the chained police officer's 
corpse in middle of the room.  Break the glass on the west wall.  An Order 
member will attack from the other side of the glass, so allow him to step into 
Room 212 then defeat him.  Step through the window area to enter Room 211.

== Room 211 ==

Take the ++MK 23 HANDGUN++ from the counter up ahead then grab the ++SECTOR 3 
KEY++ on the key rack to the right of the handgun.  You might want to examine 
the THROUGH THE FOG book on the table next to the typewriter.  Grab the --
SHOTGUN AMMUNITION-- from the cabinet near the book.  There is also a TORTURE 
LIST on the south wall to the left of the door.  The dark corridor in the 
northeast only leads to a dead end.  Open the door along the south wall and 
step back out into the hallway.

== Hallway Outside of Torture Room ==

Alex will move out into the section behind the metal bars in the west portion 
of the hall.  Look toward the left blue tank to the side of the door then check 
behind the metal crate beside that tank to find a --CHILD'S DRAWING (18/18)-- 
in between the crate and the wall.  The door to the south is locked.

If you have been collecting all the Children's Drawing up till now then you 
will receive the Nursery Rhymes achievement.

Hop back into Room 212 by moving through the window in Room 211 then step into 
the outside hall.  Two Order members will attack on the way down the hall.  Use 
the handgun to defeat one of them then use the Ceremonial Dagger to defeat the 
other.  Run back to the corridor leading to Sector 3 then duck under the bars 
and use the Sector 3 Key to unlock the door behind the bars.

== Sector 3 ==

An Order member will attack as soon as Alex enters.  The door to Room 301 is 
locked and requires a key.  Go figure.  The first room to the south is locked. 
Walk over to the door that leads to the hallway and stand in front of it to 
hear a conversation on the other side.  Take out the Steel Pipe and pry the 
door open.

== Sector 3 Hallway ==

An Order member down the hall to the west will notice Alex, so get ready to 
defeat him.  Don't move down the hall that much while fighting the first Order 
member since another will attack near the corner.

Duck under the barred gate further down the hall.  The gate will close behind 
Alex once he steps through.  Elle will scream as Room 320 is reached.  Run over 
toward Room 320 to trigger a cutscene.  This next part is indeed timed.  If 
Alex takes too long then a cutscene will play and Elle will die and the game 
will be over.

Quickly climb over the gate to the east then move over to the right side of the 
refrigerator that blocks the door to Room 321.  Use the push command to push 
the refrigerator out of the way then equip the Steel Pipe and pry the door to 
Room 321.  Step inside.

== Room 321 ==

A cutscene will trigger.  Alex will have to face off against Curtis.

Objective Update:

[ ] Save Elle.

Boss - Curtis

Curtis is really not too much of a boss at all.  His attacks with the saw are 
pretty damaging but he is very easy to hit as long as you watch for the saw 
blade.  He only has two attacks.

Saw Blade Swing Combo - Curtis swings the saw blade forward three times in a 
row.

Saw Blade Thrust - Curtis steps forward with the saw blade in front of him as 
it spins.

You don't even really have to use the dodge button that much to finish him off. 
Just stand at a distance and wait for him to finish an attack then move in and 
attack him.  It is best to hit him with the Ceremonial Dagger then step out 
from in front of him after a full A, A, A, X combo.  Wait for him to attack 
again then simply attack him while he recovers.  You can sometimes simply spam  
with a constant A, A, A, X combo.  If you ever knock him down with a charged X 
swing keep tapping X to stab him on the ground and he might not even be able to 
get up!  You can actually pin him down to the ground with charged X swings.  
Don't be afraid to charge an X slash to knock him down directly after an A, A, 
A combo since he will rarely have time to attack.

The dodge button only becomes important while in close range or if Curtis pins 
Alex to a wall.  Sometimes his slicing combo will get him too close for comfort 
also to where you will need to dodge to avoid getting hit.  Finish him off with 
whatever weapon Alex is using - Alex will finish him off with a death sequence 
just like an Order member.  Step toward the bars along the west side of the 
room to trigger a cutscene.

Objective Update:

[ ] Find Joshua.

Elle will join up with Alex for now.  Reenter Room 320 after the cutscene that 
follows then pick up the --HEALTH DRINK-- and the --FIRST AID KIT-- from the 
right counter.  You can also examine the DOCTRINE on the counter as well.  
Reenter Room 321 and take the ++ROOM 301 KEY++ from the key rack on the 
southeast wall.  Exit the room and step back out into the hall.

== Sector 3 Hallway ==

The doors to the south are both locked, so run back to the north.  Rotate the 
valve handle on the east wall.  Elle will step under the barred gate while Alex 
holds it open.  While Elle holds the valve handle on the other side to keep the 
barred gate open for Alex, step under the gate.  Move down the hallway to the 
east.

When Alex approaches the door at the end of the hall, two Order members will 
attack from the next room.  One of them carries an Assault Rifle.  Stand near 
the door and allow them to step through but try to attack them as they move 
through the door and you might be able to keep one of them from entering.  
Luckily, one of them will attack Elle, so you can attack him while he attacks 
her and finish him quickly.  Try to defeat the one with the Assault Rifle 
first.  Reenter the Sector 3 room.  Walk over to the door for Room 301 and use 
the Room 301 Key to unlock the door then step inside.

== Room 301 ==

On the desk to the left, examine the EXPERIMENT MEMO.  There is also a NOTE on 
a table behind the curtain to the right that can be examined along a PROPOGANDA 
on the desk near the window.  On the far left side of the room, step behind the 
cabinets and pick up the --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- from inside the left cabinet.  
There is some more --PISTOL AMMUNITION-- past the curtains in the cabinet off 
to the left in the north.  Inspect the duffle bag on the table to the north to 
get ++ALL WEAPONS BACK++.  In the dark corridor to the northeast, take the --
HEALTH DRINK-- from the back of the last cabinet then open the medical case on 
the back table to find a --SERUM (8/8)--.

If you have been collecting all of the Serums up till now then you will receive 
the Health Junkie achievement.

Break the glass window on the east side of the room then step over into the 
Room 302.  Take the --FIRST AID KIT-- from the shelf off to the right.  Examine 
the TORTURE LIST on the clipboard against the opposite wall.  Step back into 
Room 301 the exit the room.  Move into the hallway outside of the torture room 
to the west via the door to the west.  

== Hallway Outside of Torture Room ==

Go back to the Torture Room in the south and save your game.  Elle will not 
follow Alex into the Torture Room.  Enter the hallway to the north through the 
north door.

== Sector 1 Hallway ==

An Order member will attack from the corridor to the right as Alex steps into 
his view.  Defeat him then walk toward the barred gate at the end of the east 
hall.  All the surrounding doors in the north are locked.

Rotate the valve handle on the right wall to the east then Elle will rotate the 
valve handle on the other side to allow Alex through the rest of the east hall. 
Duck under the barred gate like usual.  The door to the east down the hall 
cannot be opened.  Open the door to Room 113 then step inside.

== Room 113 ==

Pick up the ++POLICE MARKSMAN RIFLE++ off the left desk then grab the --SHOTGUN 
AMMUNITION-- from the cabinet next to the dark corridor in the north.  The SET 
OF BYLAWS book on the right table can be examined.  Break the glass on the 
right wall and step over into Room 112.

Step toward the body strapped to the center chair.  A cutscene will play then a 
choice can be made afterwards.

bastard!

Open the door to Room 111 to trigger a cutscene.

== Room 111 ==

Alex will be by himself once again.  Move past the hanging body bags and open 
the door to the south then exit the room.

== Sector 1 (East) ==

All side doors are locked to the east.  The familiar sounds of a shoreline that 
were last heard in the Otherworld Alchemilla Hospital can be heard as Alex 
moves to the east down the corridor.  Open the door at the very end of the 
corridor.

== Save Room ==

Save your game at the !!SAVE POINT!! on the right wall.  All other doors except 
the door to the big room in the east are locked.  Open the door to the east 
then step into the room.

== Founding Family Chamber ==

Examine the PRESCRIPTION PAD on the floor.  The door to the east is locked and 
the door to the south is locked and requires you to solve the puzzle in this 
room in order to unlock it.

There are four tablets on the walls around this room.  Find the slits in the 
metal pieces on the column to the right of each tablet then use the Ceremonial 
Dagger on each slit to remove the covering from each tablet.  All tablets 
mention the four founding families of Shepherd's Glen and they all read just 
about the same except for the fate of each child.

++ FLOOR INSIGNIA PUZZLE ++

From left to right, the tablets list the fate of the children as follows:

Shepherd family = Water
Fitch family = Knife
Holloway family = Noose
Bartlett family = Earth

Examine the circular pedestal in the north portion of this room.  A ring is 
showcased on the puzzle along with several symbols.  X turns the inner ring 
counterclockwise and A turns the outer ring clockwise.

All the images must be lined up along the circle so that the three founding 
member, Bartlett, Holloway, and Fitch are represented based on the symbols.  
The main hint as to how the symbols should be lined up is realized through the 
prescription pad on the ground.  Since this is Dr. Fitch's prescription pad, 
one would assume that this circular portion represents him, so all of his 
symbols go on the lower right side of the floor ring.

The inner ring needs to showcase:

- the symbol of air/wind on top (Holloway).

- the set of mountains symbol on the lower left (Bartlett).

- the stick figure on the lower right (Fitch).

The outer ring needs to showcase:

- the cross with two triangles dangling from it on top
- the eye on the lower right
- the curved lines by the triangle

Everything should be showcased as follows:


                  ___
                 /\|/\
                   |
                  / \
                  ~~~
                   ~~
                         o
           /`/\`\       -|-
                        / \
     // |/\                 |(O)|

Quick Solution:

From the moment that Alex first examines the pedestal rotate the rings in the 
following order:

Inner Circle: Rotate two times.
Outer Circle: Rotate eight times.

Once the rings are positioned properly, a cutscene will trigger as the lights 
in the room shutoff and a spotlight showcases the door to the south - the door 
open up its front seal.

Investigate the seal on the door.  Another puzzle is revealed!

++ DOOR INSIGNIA PUZZLE ++

Tap left and right on the left analog to highlight each circle on the door then 
tap up and down to rotate the circle clockwise and counterclockwise 
respectively.

Outer circle = curved pitchfork?

Inner circle = water surface with water drop above it

The two symbols appear to be something like this horrid diagram while on top of 
each other:

   3--
    uu <-- Curved pitchfork

    |
   (o) <-- Water drop
  ~~~~~

Here is a simple explanation:

Inner circle = Rotate clockwise or counterclockwise four times.  (the symbol is 
on the bottom so either way will do).

Outer circle = Rotate clockwise three times.

Once the puzzle on the door is connected properly then the door will open!  Go 
back into the save room and save your game.  Enter the room behind the puzzle 
door.

== Sacrificial Chamber ==

Walk toward the four altars up ahead and examine the carvings along the side of 
each altar.  A cutscene will trigger after examining the Shepherd's Altar on 
the south side of the room.

Boss - Amnion

This boss is pretty creepy and you really don't want to get close to it, but 
you have to get to it's mid body in order to damage it.  The boss' attacks are 
pretty easy to see coming so they aren't that hard to dodge.  All you really 
have to do is press the dodge button any time that the boss raises one of its 
front legs or when it jumps or moves in any way that is sudden.  It will 
sometimes attack twice after raising a front leg so always be prepared for 
another swing if Alex doesn't roll to one of its sides.

Leg Swing and Overhead Swing - Amnion swings its right front left to the left 
then performs and overhead ground pound.

Black Spray - Amnion quickly lifts its front two legs into the air then lets 
them fall and leans its head forward to spray black liquid in front of it.

Jump - Amnion jumps into the air then lands on whatever is below it.

In order to hit the boss, you'll have to dodge its attacks then Alex will roll 
to the side and basically move up under the side legs of the boss.  At that 
time, take out a melee weapon and attack the boss.  Use combos swings and 
charged X swings to hit it.  It will eventually jump in an attempt to smash 
Alex.  When it jumps, press the dodge button to roll out of the way of its 
falling attack.

Instead of using a melee weapon, you can also run a distance away from it and 
shoot it with the firearm.  Getting close and shooting it with the shotgun will 
stagger it, but you'll be wide open to attack while close to it with the 
shotgun equipped.  The shotgun will damage it badly though. Once the boss has 
been hit enough times then the second stage of the boss battle will commence 
after the slight cutscene.

The boss will raise its front legs into the air during this portion of the 
battle.  Its attack are extremely quick during this fight, so you basically 
have to react as soon as the boss moves one its legs to attack if you choose to 
stay close to it.

Two Hit Swing - Amnion swings one of its front legs one way then quickly swings 
it back the other way.

Two Leg Grab - Amnion holds both front legs into the air then reaches forth or 
under its body to grab.

Black Spray - Amnion leans upward then sprays black liquid into the area in 
front of it.

Front Leg Smash - Amnion lifts both front legs into the air then hits the 
ground in front of it.

The only real way to get up to it to hit it with a melee weapon from close 
range is to move around it while it sprays black liquid in front of it.  It can 
so easily grab Alex out from under its body though.  The grab can be avoided by 
tapping the dodge button to roll out from the under the boss as it attacks 
however, so melee combat can still be used.

The boss has one major flaw that will carry it to its grave however.  There is 
an overhead smash that it will start to perform once Alex has damaged it a bit 
during this second portion of the battle.  I would recommend shooting it with 
the shotgun or rifle a few times in order to make it do this move.

Run away from it and stand about mid distance from it.  It will eventually hold 
up both of its front legs to attack.  Stay away from it while it plows its 
front legs into the ground or simply press the dodge button when it lifts both 
front legs into the air.  It will get its front legs stuck in the floor.  While 
its legs are in the floor, it will struggle to get them out and give you a 
chance to damage it badly, so run up to its body and shoot or hit it with a 
melee weapon.  After it has sustained enough damage through a melee attack, it 
will hunch over in a dazed state, barely able to stand.  Approach the boss and 
deliver the finishing blow with the X button!

You will receive an achievement after defeating Amnion.

===============================================================================

=====
Nurse
=====

Once again the famed Silent Hill nurse returns in another installment.  This 
time she has the appearance of the Silent Hill movie Nurse and is equipped with 
a scalpel.  Nurses move in short sudden bursts as if they are having spasms 
while they walk.  A sound of a snapshot being taken can be heard as they walk 
sometimes.

-- Weakness

In Homecoming, Nurses' behavior will depend on two things.  If Alex has his 
flashlight on or if Alex makes a lot of noise (runs or bumps into nearby 
objects) then a Nurse will attack him if it is in the area.  If Alex does not 
turn on the flashlight or make any major noise then the Nurse will remain still 
and motionless and not attack Alex.

Nurses are very interesting to mess around with.  If Alex runs then suddenly 
starts walking, the Nurse will move to the area where Alex last stopped 
running.  Alex can actually walk right against a Nurse without it attacking him 
no matter what side it is approached from as long as he does not run or turn on 
the flashlight.  The Nurse will not attack or even move while it is motionless 
unless Alex runs or turns on the flashlight.  Nurses sometimes seem to have a 
slight bit of unpredictability to their movement at times however, especially 
later in the game.

Nurses can be brutal by the time Alex reaches the Grand Hotel.  This is when 
they become more aggressive and will literally walk toward Alex with a constant 
two-hit slash at times.  Be sure to dodge out of the way if they ever start to 
constantly slash Travis.  In Hard mode the Nurses can be total beasts after the 
hospital nightmare.  Their two hit slash can tear through Alex extremely quick. 
The handgun from long range or simply skipping them is the best approach for 
Hard mode.

-- Attacks

Scalpel Combo - The Nurse quickly swings its right scalpel hand to the left 
then swings it back to the right.

Dodge timing: The timing for a correct dodge for this move (where Alex moves 
behind her) is extremely tough since you must press the dodge button as soon as 
the Nurse holds her scalpel to the side.  Both swings must be dodged if Alex 
doesn't step behind the Nurse during the first swing.

Shouting Scalpel Combo - The Nurse holds up its right hand with the scalpel 
back and shouts then steps in with two swings - one to the right then one to 
the left.

Dodge timing: Dodge right as the Nurse holds up its right hand and Alex will 
move to the back of the Nurse.  The second swing can be dodge just like the 
first but there is no need to dodge it if Alex dodges the first swing 
appropriately.

Overhead Swing - The Nurse steps forward and slashes downward.

Dodge timing: Dodge right before the slash.

Scalpel Stab - The Nurse holds both hands back behind its left side then 
attempts to plunge the scalpel forward into its victim.  It usually performs 

this while in close range after a two-hit scalpel combo.

Dodge timing: Dodge right when the Nurse holds both of its arms back.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed Stance: When the Nurse falls to her knees

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - Alex grabs the back of the Nurse's head while 
she is kneeling then stabs the Nurse in the throat two times.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - Alex swings the pipe directly into the Nurse's head while 
she is leaned over then stabs her with the pipe while she is on the ground.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - Alex stands behind the Nurse then executes her by 
chopping off her head while she kneels.

=====
Swarm
=====

Think of a Swarm as a group of much bigger than normal roaches that need to be 
squashed.  They almost always attack in packs and attach themselves to their 
prey to bite.

-- Weakness

Swarms can be defeated easily in three ways:

a) Hold LT to enter combat stance while a melee weapon is equipped then tap the
   A button to stomp them while they are near Alex
b) When one of them flies in front of Alex, hit it with a melee weapon.
c) When they attach to Alex, mash the B button to make Alex grab one then tap 
   the button that appears on the screen to throw the captured bug to the
   ground and destroy it.

Try to squash them when they are all grouped together and Alex will step on 
multiple bugs at a time for a nice juicy explosion of bug bits.

-- Attacks

Bite - Swarm jumps on its victim and bites it continuously.

-- Finishers

N/A

=====
Feral
=====

The Feral's attacks are some of the hardest to dodge since it gives such little 
warning for each of its attacks and it seems to be unpredictable at times.  It 
is best to pin this enemy down and show no mercy while attacking it.  Running 
from it can be just as deadly as fighting it since it can easily keep up with 
Alex and even lunge at him from behind while he runs and actually catch him!

-- Weakness

In order to fight a Feral, get in close range with the knife and slash at it 
with a full A, A, A, X combo to pin it down.  It can attack right after the X 
slash (usually a bite attack), so you may have to dodge right after the final 
button press.  Most of the time you can completely pin a Feral down with a 
constant A, A, A, X combo sequence with the knife.  If you can afford to get in 
a charged X attack after a dodge then you might be able to finish the Feral off 
with a X slash while it is on the ground also, but this usually requires some 
well timed dodging.

The Feral can be shot out of lunge attack by shooting it with a gun while it 
dashes.  It will fall to the ground and be left open at that time.  I don't 
really like this method, tell you the truth, since Alex is too wide open while 
a firearm is equipped and they usually only lunge from mid-distance.

The Steel Pipe/Crowbar is sometimes useful against a Feral if you can manage to 
get in a charged X attack after a dodge or while surprising a Feral.  A charged 
X attack will knock it down to where it can be hit with another charged X 
attack.

Knocking a Feral down with just about any melee weapon will almost guarantee 
you a finisher move if you run over to it and hold LT then tap X quick enough 
while it is still grounded.

-- Attacks

Bite - Feral quickly leans back and snaps its jaws upwards.

Dodge Timing: Dodge right as the Feral moves upward to bite.  This attack is 
extremely hard to get away from.

Jumping Paw Swing - Feral moves in from a distance then jumps and swings its 
paw.

Dodge Timing: This can be dodged right as the Feral jumps.

Lunging Takedown - The Feral will move to the side then suddenly face its prey 
right before it jumps with its mouth toward them.  Sometimes it only moves 
forward and stop shortly before jumping.

Dodge Timing - Watch for the Feral to move to the side to know when it is about 
to perform this attack then press the dodge button as soon as it faces Alex 
since it will lunge shortly thereafter.  The Feral will not always follow up a 
side walk with a lunge however.  There are times where it seems to lunge 
shortly after moving forward and stopping, usually when getting up from being 
knocked down.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed Stance: When a Feral is knocked to the ground and it is low in health

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - Alex kneels down then sinks the knife into the 
side of the Feral's neck as he tears and cuts the creature's head off shortly 
before tossing it to the side.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - While the Feral is on the ground, Alex drives his pipe 
through the side of the creature's head twice then stomps its head shortly 
after pulling the pipe out.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - Alex walks up to the fallen Feral then raises his axe 
and chops its head off while it lies on the ground.

======
Lurker
======

The Lurker is usually found in shallow water, waiting for a victim to move near 
it so it can quickly emerge and attack.  It has no legs and pulls itself with 
its arms.  Lurkers are also found along the streets at times where they will 
crawl out from gutters to attack.

-- Weakness

It can be hard to dodge a Lurker's attack, so run around it and wait for it to 
perform a lunge then run up to it as it recovers from the lunge and attack.  
The Steel Pipe/Crowbar melee weapon works the best for attacking a Lurker early 
in the game since you can easily get a full combo out on it without worrying 
about a counter hit. Hit it with an A, A, X combo to knock it down to the 
ground, face first, and stun it for a few seconds.  It's weak head will be in 
full view.  Charge an X swing while above it at that time and Alex will smash 
its head.

Later in the game, ether of the axe weapons will immediately kill it by 
chopping its head off with one X attack.  An A attack will randomly perform an 
instant kill but an X attack is guaranteed.  Sometimes they still attack while 
their head is cut off after chopping it off with the axe though, so prepare to 
dodge at times.

These enemies are only hard at times because of the water environment that Alex 
will fight them in most of the time - it covers their movement well.  While 
they are on the Streets pf Shepherd's Glen early in the game or the Streets of 
Silent Hill later in the game, they are incredibly predictable since they can 
be seen in full view.  At that time, you can even see a Lurker well enough to 
dodge a claw slash.

-- Attacks

Claw Slice - Lurker slashes with one of its claw arms.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button as soon as you see one of its arms move 
for the attack.

Lunge - Lurker scoots forward with its arms then suddenly jumps directly ahead.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button right as the Lurker scoots forward before 
it jumps.

-- Finishers

A Lurker has no death sequences like the other enemies but it can still be 
killed in brutal ways depending on the weapon Alex has equipped.  It will lean 
over when it is one hit away from death but no true cinematic finisher can be 
performed.

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - A charged X stab for a final hit will 
sometimes stab through the Lurker's neck.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - Hitting a Lurker with a charged X hit will usually smash 
its head if the Lurker is face down on the ground in front of Alex.  Perform a 
charge hit after an A, A, X combo.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - An X attack will always chop off a Lurker's head and an 
A attack will randomly chop off its head.

====
Smog
====

Much like a Straight-jacket enemy, the Smog resembles a human but does not have 
any arms.  It is usually found in the streets.  All of its attacks are 
performed after it opens its chest to showcase its sharp rib bones to attack or 
breathe out a poison smoke from its glowing lungs.

-- Weakness

The Smog is weakest against a handgun.  Stand at a distance and wait for it to 
perform one of its attacks where it opens its chest to spray smoke.  Once it 
reveals its orange lungs inside of its chest, shoot the lungs and this will 
badly damage the Smog.  Two shots in the lungs will automatically defeat it.  
You have to move toward it sometimes then step away to get it to open its 
chest.  It has two smoke attacks where it will reveal its lungs.  It's best to 
shoot it during the spray attack though instead of the closer smoke screen 
attack.

A Smog is just as weak to a melee weapon as it is to a handgun when it reveals 
its lungs, but you'll have to get in closer to hit it, obviously.  Wait for it 
to inhale deeply then move toward it and hit its front half (the lungs) as it 
opens its chest.  The knife's X attack works extremely well for hitting it in 
its lungs thanks to the stab animation.  An attack with a melee weapon done 
right after stepping toward a Smog with its lungs showcased should be enough to 
knock it down, allowing Alex to stand over the Smog and hit it while it is 
grounded - the step I'm referring to is a counter attack (hold LT, then forward 
+ B and attack)

-- Attacks

Rib Stab - Smog quickly kneels and opens its chest then dashes forward to stab 
its victim with its sharp rib bones.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button the moment the Smog kneels downward to 
prepare the ram.

Smoke Screen - Smog quickly ducks down as it opens its chest and spreads smoke 
all around its front portion.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button as Smog rises from its crouching state, 
right before it sprays out smoke.

Smoke Spray: Smog inhales then opens its chest to reveal its glowing lungs then 
spray forth a black spray of poisonous smoke.

Dodge Timing: This attack can be dodged like all the others but Alex has to be 
in close range.  Move toward the Smog as it inhales then press the dodge button 
right before it sprays smoke.  The bad part about dodging to the side while 
close to it is that the smoke might still hit Alex.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed Stance: The Smog stands still in a stunned state.  It's very hard to 
tell when a Smog is open to a finisher because its staggering state really 
looks no different than its normal standing state.  It is also very hard to get 
it in this state.

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - Alex plunges the knife/dagger directly into 
the Smog's lungs then removes the blade.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - Alex stabs the Smog in the lungs with the pipe/crowbar 
then pulls the pipe/crowbar downward through its chest while tearing the weapon 
out.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - Alex plunges the axe into the Smog's chest and drives 
the blade downward through its top half before taking it out.

=======
Needler
=======

A Needler has two big blade arms on its front side and back side that it uses 
for climbing structures and attacking its prey.  The Needler shields itself 
with its large front arms, so it must be hit during an attack of its own or 
from the side to damage it.

-- Weakness

A Needler's head is its main weak spot but it shields its head with its arm 
blades most of the time.  It's also weak from either of its sides since it 
can't defend in those two areas.

Equip a melee weapon and dodge its attacks then counter the Needler with a 
strong attack or quick counter attack.  Sometimes Alex can get off a full combo 
from its side after dodging its attack.  It's not that hard to see a Needler's 
attacks as it prepares to swing, so just dodge its attacks and allow Alex to 
move to the side of it then hit it or hit it from the front after dodging one 
of its attacks - you might hit it during its counter attack.  A lot of times it 
will try to attack right as Alex finishes charging a strong combat knife attack 
and leaves itself wide open to the attack as Alex performs finishes the charge. 
Even though it will block from its front side, sometimes Alex can still hit the 
Needler when it tries to counter.  A Needler is extremely defenseless right 
after dodging one of its double bladed stabs, so always be prepared to attack 
right after dodging this move if Alex happens to get knocked down.

The Needler can be shot in the head with a handgun but you must wait until 
right before it attacks then blast it in the head or else it will block the 
bullet with one of its blade arms.  This method is risky since Alex is wide 
open to its attacks while aiming the gun.  I wouldn't recommend this method at 
all really, but the game seems to think that it works well judging by the tip 
during loading screens - might be from a beta copy of SH: Homecoming.  One 
interesting aspect of the head weakness is that a Needler can actually be hit 
in the head with a melee weapon for an instant kill, but this is more about 
luck than anything else.

-- Attacks

Blade Slash - The Needler quickly holds up its right blade arm and slashes to 
the side.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button right when the Needler holds up its arm.

Side Slash - While its prey is to one of its sides the Needler performs a quick 
slash to that side.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button right when the Needler moves its arm for 
the side slash.  Since it only performs this move while Alex is on either side 
of it, just dodge when you see a sudden movement while on either side.  This is 
its quickest attack however so it takes practice.

Knockdown Stab - The Needler holds up its left blade arm then quickly pokes it 
forward to knock down its prey.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button right when the Needler holds up its blade 
arm to poke it forward.

Double Blade Stab - The Needler lifts both of its blade arms upward then stabs 
them into the ground in front of it.

Dodge Timing: The Needler will only do this while Alex is on the floor after a 
knockdown, so mash the B button to roll to the side.  The Needler is left 
completely open to an attack after this move.

Ceiling Lunge - Needler climbs to the ceiling then lunges at its prey.

Dodge Timing: Dodge right when it lunges to roll out of the way.

Stabbing Grab - The Needler grabs Alex with its left blade arm and attempts to 
stab him in the throat with its other blade arm as Alex tries his best to hold 
the blade arm back.

Dodge Timing: The Needler sneaks this attack in, so it basically looks like its 
other attacks.  In order to escape the grab, if the Needler grabs Alex, you'll 
need to mash the button that appears on the screen during the grab animation.  
If you miss the command then Alex will automatically get killed by the Needler.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed Stance: While the Needler is laid out on the ground from receiving too
  much damage.

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - Alex grabs the Needler then stabs it in the 
head and throws it down to the ground.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - Alex plunges the weapon through the Needler's back.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - Alex plants the blade of the axe right through the top 
portion of the Needler's head while it is on the ground.

======
Schism
======

A Schism has multiple sharp appendages which it uses to attack with.  Its head 
is slanted and sharp like a blade and both of its hands (its fingers) are sharp 
as well. These enemies are very fierce when fought in packs, so always try to 
distance them away from each other or simply run!

-- Weakness

A Schism is a very tough enemy but it is also very weak to a shotgun blast.  A 
blast from the normal shotgun will damage it greatly to where any other attack 
will be enough to finish it off.  A blast with the Bluesteel Shotgun is enough 
to kill it in one shot depending on your range.  Please be advised that it will 
only kill them with one shot in Normal mode, not Hard.

To save ammo early in the game when the Schisms first appear, shoot one with a 
shotgun blast to knock it down then switch to either the handgun or a melee 
weapon and hit it one time while it is grounded to finish it off.

Fighting a Schism with a melee weapon can be done if you can dodge its attacks 
well.  The grab attack requires some unusual timing, so be sure to dodge 
earlier than normal when you see the Schism lift its head and point it toward 
Alex to get away from this attack.  Perform quick attacks and DO NOT charge 
attacks unless the Schism has been knocked to the floor!  Counter attacks done 
right after a dodge work very well against a Schism since they knock it out of 
attacks.  Counter attacks are about the only way to get it to stagger so Alex 
can perform a finisher to it.

-- Attacks

Head Blade Combo - Schism slaps its blade head to the left and then to the 
right.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button the moment the Schism holds its head back 
for the first swing.  Both head swings must be dodged if the first is not timed 
precisely.

Head Uppercut - Schism ducks then uppercuts with its blade head.

Dodge Timing: Dodge the moment the Schism ducks.  This one has to be done very 
fast.

Arm Swing - Schism leans back and then swings its arm as it moves forward.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button as soon as the Schism leans back to 
perform the swing.

Lunging Head Stab - The Schism holds its head directly upwards then lunges 
straight ahead to stab with its blade head.

Dodge Timing - Press the dodge button as the Schism runs toward Alex.  This one 
can be hard to dodge because it can be mistaken for the lunging grab - remember 
that the Schism holds his head directly upwards before starting this attack.

Grabbing Lunge - Schism raises its head higher than normal and looks forward 
then growls and then lunges forward and grabs with its hand.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button right as the Schism holds up its head.  
This dodge has to be done earlier than you would normally think - if you dodge 
as the Schism rushes toward Alex then it will always grab him.  The biggest 
difference between this move and the head stab lunge is that the Schism will 
not holds its head directly up to the ceiling before executing this attack.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed Stance: The Schism staggers while standing and holding its head 
  downwards.

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - Alex grabs the Schism and slices all around 
its neck then kicks it down as its head falls off.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - Alex busts the Schism over the head with the weapon to 
knock it down then clobbers it again and finally plunges the weapon into the 
Schism.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - Alex drives his axe into the back of the Schism's head 
then jerks the axe back and cuts the Schism's head off.

====
Siam
====

Don't make fun of the female legs on its backside or the Siam will pulverize 
you with its big front arms.  A Siam use its back legs and front arms to move 
but it will only attack with its front arms.  The Siam is much faster than you 
would normally expect and it can pin down a foe very quickly.

-- Weakness

Its major weakness is its backside.  The Siam has two female legs sticking out 
its back.  If Alex can get behind it by dodging its attack then hitting it in 
the back will take more damage - this is much easier said than done however.

Don't ever run from a Siam that much unless you're already at a distance from 
it!  Target it with a melee weapon while close and dodge its attacks.  Even 
guessing on the timing of dodging its attacks is better than trying to run from 
close range.  Running from close range will only allow the Siam to hit Alex and 
combo its attacks on him.

Learn to dodge its attacks and you can easily get behind it, to its weak point 
then simply hit it along the backside.  The main problem with this however, is 
that Alex usually dodges too far away from the Siam to get in a hit.  This is 
why it is best to change to the shotgun after dodging.

A Siam is very weak against either shotgun.  It will fall within three shotgun 
blasts no matter where it is hit.  While fighting one it is best to switch 
between a melee weapon and the shotgun to dodge its attacks safely and hit it 
from behind with a powerful blast.

It is also weak against any other type of gun besides the shotgun.  The handgun 
and rifle will make the Siam pause per shot fired.  While it is readying an 
attack, you can simply aim and shoot at it to hit it and delay the attack a 
pretty good bit.

If you decide to take on the Siam with a melee weapon then use the Combat 
Knife/Ceremonial Dagger for its speed, this will allow Alex to easily sidestep 
after an attack sequence since he won't have as much recovery time per attack 
when compared to pipe/crowbar or axe swings.  The weapon(s) work surprisingly 
well against a Siam.

-- Attacks

Straight Punch - Siam holds up its right arm and rushes forward with a punch. 
It might perform an Arm Swing after this attack

Dodge Timing - Press the dodge button while the Siam is running forward with 
its arm up.

Arm Swing - Siam swings one of its arms forward.  It sometimes does this twice 
in a row with the same arm.  It might perform a Double Arm Smash after this 
attack.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button while the Siam holds its arm to the side.

Double Arm Smash - Siam raises both of its arms behind it then steps forward 
with a two arm crush as its arms come together.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button right before its arms close together.

Turning Swing - While turning around, Siam turns and swings its arm at the same 
time.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button while the Siam is turning.

Ground Smash - Siam holds up both of its arms and pounds the ground with its 
fists while its victim is grounded.

Dodge Timing: After being knocked down, press the dodge button while on the 
ground to roll away from this attack.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed Stance: Siam stops and falls then leans over.

Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger - While the Siam's leans over, Alex drives the 
blade into the female back portion and forces the Siam to the ground then pulls 
the knife out.

Steep Pipe/Crowbar - Alex swings his pipe into the Siam to knock it down then 
plunges the pipe through the Siam's back. 

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - Alex chops the Siam's head off while it kneels.

============
Order Member
============

These are human members of the Order from Silent Hill.  They wear a mining 
outfit to shield themselves and disguise their face.  They will attack with 
either a steel pipe or an assault rifle.  These members can be just as deadly 
as our lead character since they share nearly the same exact moves as him when 
he equips either weapon.

-- Weakness

Order members are really easy to shoot while they are not in close range.  Aim 
for their head to inflict more damage per shot.  The shotgun will nearly kill 
one of them with one shot and the Assault Rifle and handgun work just as well.

The Ceremonial Dagger is really the best melee weapon to use against an Order 
member because of its speed.  Move in with an A, A, A, X combo and you will be 
able follow it up with another combo afterwards because of the dagger's speed. 
The Steel Pipe/Crowbar's A, A, X combo also works well for them since they will 
usually dodge the first swing, and get hit by the second and third swing.

For an Order member with a pipe, the combo A, A, A, charge X works very well 
also.  They will usually stand still while the X attack is charging and it will 
hit the Order member and knock him down.  Run up to him at that time and hit 
him with charged X stabs while he is on the ground.

Order members with pipes dodge Alex's attack quite a bit if you use the pipe or 
axe, but they have problems dodging the knife.  Even when they do dodge a pipe 
or axe attack, they can usually be hit right after they dodge if Alex is in the 
middle of a combo.

Order members with assault rifles are some of the most dangerous mainly due to 
their melee attacks.  While in close their melee gun attacks can easily knock 
Alex out of any type of attack.  Make sure to use A, A, A, X combos with the 
dagger while in close to the ones with assault rifles and don't charge an 
attack.

-- Attacks

Pipe Combo - Order member swings to the left then to the right and then 
performs an overhead hit.  This is the exact same combo that Alex can perform 
with the pipe or crowbar.  Sometimes the Order member will end this combo 
early.

Dodge Timing: Press the dodge button as soon as the Order member holds the pipe 
to his side.

-- Finishers

+ Dazed State: When the Order member stands still in a stunned state.

Ceremonial Dagger - Alex grabs the Order member from the back and slices his 
throat.

Steel Pipe/Crowbar - Alex jabs the pipe into the Order member's chest then 
performs an upward swing to the Order member's head when he kneels over.

Fire Axe/Pulaski Axe - While the Order member is on his knees, Alex drives the 
axe directly into the top middle portion of the Order member's head then kicks 
the Order member off the axe.

squeeze through some pipes and find this weapon on a table behind those pipes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two stones must be collected in order to get this:

Garnet - Walk through the south entrance corridor of the Dargento Cemetery then

Hill map).  A Smog will appear in the Sun Garden once Alex enters the corridor 
to the west.

Right when you come to the corridor that leads out of the Sun Garden and moves 
to the west, turn to the north wall and look for a few holes in the wall then

and use the command to tear open the wall.  Walk over to the concrete bench to 
the right past the wall and collect the Garnet stone from the bench.

Dargento Cemetery through the south entrance then run all the way back to Janus 
Garden.  Place the Turquoise stone in the front circular slot of the statue and 
place the Garnet stone in the back circular slot of the statue.  The Moon 
Garden Key will fall out from the opening on the right side of the statue.  
Find the Moon Garden gate on your map then go there and unlock the gate with 
the Moon Garden Key.

A Smog will attack in the Moon Garden.  Defeat him then walk over to the 
mausoleum that he was standing near.  There is a crack in the wall near a pool 
of blood and there is a weapon slightly visible under the crack in the wall of 
the mausoleum.  Grab the M14 Assault Rifle from the crack.

Area: Overlook Penitentiary
Location: B Block North

Details: Enter the Upper Guard Room after climbing the west staircase once the 
Siam is defeated following the cutscene where Wheeler is freed from his cell. 
This drawing will be on the side of the damaged wall.

[ ] Child's Drawing 17

And while good children live, bad ones cannot escape their fate.  For once you 
hear his screeching wail, it's already too late.

Area: Otherworld Church
Location: Main Hall (behind organ wall)

Details: After placing all the plates on the wall of the organ in the Main 
Hall, a cutscene involving the Bogeyman (Pyramid Head) will play.  After the 
cutscene, move through the remains of the person then turn left while on the 
other side of the wooden torture device and this will be on the side of the 
left crate in between the wooden torture device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Child's Drawing 18

So do not cry aloud at night, stay hidden in your bed... Or the Bogeyman from 
Silent Hill will come chop off your head.

Area: Lair
Location: Hallway Outside of Torture Room

Details: After breaking the window along the west wall of Room 212 and stepping 
through to Room 211, exit the south door and step into the section of the hall 
behind the bars on the west side.  To the south is a door with a blue tank on 
the left side of it.  To find this drawing, check in between the section of the 
east wall and the metal crate that is in front of a tank.

*******************************************************************************

* WARNING: The ending requirements are composed of spoilers!

SPECIAL NOTE: You DO NOT have to beat the full game five times in order to get 
all of these endings.  Make a separate game save at the Hallway South of A 
Block in the Overlook Penitentiary and this file can then be loaded up at any 
time to gain any ending in the game by playing through starting from this 
portion of the game.  Just make sure to not delete this save until you have got 
all the endings.  This save is right before the first decision that affects the 
ending.

=======================                       ==========================
HAPPY ENDING - ENDING 1                       HOSPITAL ENDING - ENDING 4

*******************************************************************************
                          EXTRA CUTSCENE AFTER CREDITS
*******************************************************************************

Collect all 11 photos throughout the game and an extra cutscene will trigger 
after the ending credits.  This will trigger regardless of whichever ending 
plays once the game is beaten.


*******************************************************************************
                                    COSTUMES
*******************************************************************************

Unlockable costumes may be chosen from the costume menu following the 
difficulty selection when starting a New Game once the game has been beaten and 
saved afterwards.

* WARNING: You MUST save your game after each ending for the unlocked costume 
to appear after starting a new game.  Once the game is saved following the 
ending, that save can be overwritten and the costume will still appear on the 
outfit menu when starting a new game.

This is the exact order that the costumes will appear in on the costume menu:

============
Classic Alex
============

Unlocked by default.  Default outfit.

==========
Young Alex
==========

Enter the following code at the title screen, when "Press Start" is displayed:

** Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B **

A sound will confirm the entry - it sounds much like pressing start on the 
title screen.  The costume will appear under "Classic Alex" in the costume 
select menu.

===========
Deputy Alex
===========

Achieve the UFO ending.

============
Big Rig Alex
============

Achieve the Happy ending.

=======
ER Alex
=======

Achieve the Hospital ending.

==================
Order Soldier Alex
==================

Achieve the Drowning ending.

=============
Bogeyman Alex
=============

Achieve the Bogeyman ending.


*******************************************************************************
                                 SPECIAL WEAPONS
*******************************************************************************

============
Circular Saw
============

After the game has been beaten once and you have saved when prompted after the 
credits, this saw will appear in the garage of the Shepherd House when you 
start a new game.  It will be off to the left as Alex enters the garage after 
obtaining the garage remote.

============
Laser Pistol
============

Obtain the UFO ending then save your game after the credits.

Start a new game and this item will be on the trunk to the right of the two 
beds in Josh and Alex's Room.

                               VERSION HISTORY                           [VH00]
*******************************************************************************

Version 0.9 - Most of the guide is finished.  I need to go back through and 
redo a few areas however.  Some of the enemy strategies, mainly in the 
walkthrough don't match up with some of the newer strategies I have found.

Version 1.0 - Save Point list was added and tons of corrections were made here 
and there.  Intro and other sections were updated with extra info also.  
Thankfully, no one caught the Travis mention or the Siren Blood Curse Copyright 
mistake - you see, I use my older guides as a template for newer guides and 
sometimes I accidentally leave some older info in my new guides. :)

Version 1.1 - A Weapon list is now up in the list section.  A few typos have 
been destroyed and reborn as actual words and phrases also.  Some typos still 
linger though, so email me if you notice one.

Version 1.1 - Typos were corrected in the Enemies section.  Big thanks to Jim 
for pointing out a mistake dealing with the Happy ending!

Version 1.1 - (10/22/08) - Document is fully proofread at last!  Siam knife 
finisher was added thanks to a reader.

Version 1.1 - (11/03/08) - Siam knife finisher revised.  A few glitch warnings 
added, one in the Sewers right before Siam fight and another in the Church 
before the plate puzzle.

Version 1.1 - (11/07/08) - A typo dealing with a decision was corrected.  A 
glitch warning was added that deals with the cutscenes after the Church area.

Version 1.2 - (11/12/08) - Added a note about an image of Alex's father that 
can be seen through the cloth sheet in the basement before cutting the sheet - 
see added "Special Note" in the walkthrough during the first arrival in the 
basement of the Shepherd House for more info.  Also added the finishing move 
for the Feral while equipped with the axe.  A tip was added to the fight with 
the three Needlers and the Siam in the Main Drain Chamber of the Sewers.  
Another note was added to the Scarlet fight before the second battle with her.

If anyone can describe the Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger finishing move when 
fighting a Smog then please email me.  It is the ONLY little detail left that I 
want to add for a complete guide.

Version 1.2 - (11/18/08) - Corrected a few mistakes here and these thanks to 
Rob.  A new valuable health tip is now listed under the Health section in 
Basics.  The Smog now has a Combat Knife/Ceremonial Dagger finisher description 
now as well thanks to a reader.  I now dub Silent Hill Homecoming 
FAQ/Walkthrough by Berserker as finished!  I'm still accepting additions 
though.

Version 1.2 - (12/03/08) - A few small typos were corrected.  A glitch warning 
dealing with a save point was updated for the Sewers (mentioned earlier since a 
reader fell victim to it before reading the small note about it) and another 
glitch warning dealing with the clock puzzle was added to the Otherworld 
Shepherd House section.  I might simply make a section devoted to game glitches 
in the next update since this game is so prone to messing up at key points.

Version 1.2 - (12/19/08) - Added an extra attack (stabbing grab) for the 
Needler in the enemies section.

Version 1.3 - (01/05/09) - Added several game bug warnings to the Shepherd 
House and the Otherworld Church.  I have started to number them now in those 
areas.  I might make up a bug section with just a list of game bugs in the 
future since I am getting quite a few of them emailed to me.  I have also added 
a Donation section a few sections below this one along with a mention of my 
Dead Space Featured Guide now on Cheat Happens.

Be sure to check out my recent FAQ Writer of the Month interview at IGN for 
December 2008:

http://faqs.ign.com/articles/941/941068p1.html

Version 1.3 - (01/26/09) - Game bug #6 in the Otherworld Shepherd House is now 
confirmed by a reader.

*******************************************************************************

I can be reached at my email address, which is berserker_kev(at)yahoo.com, so 
please contact me if you have any questions, comments, etc.  Replace the (at) 
with @.  I don't mind receiving emails at all.  Don't add me to your Yahoo 
Messenger please, an email will do.

I do have a few guidelines however:

1) Give me a subject in the email, preferably one including the name of the 
   game.  An actual subject looks damn sexy in my inbox compared to an 
   unattractive blank subject line.
2) Read the guide over and make sure that your question is not already 
   answered.
3) Please speak in English and attempt to use some correct grammar.  This is in
   no way meant to offend those that cannot speak English well.  I have spoken 
   with some readers that claim they cannot speak English when, in fact, they 
   speak better English then some Americans.  So basically if you "try" to talk
   to me then that is good enough. :)

And last, but not least, if you found this walkthrough helpful, an email would 
be most appreciated or you could sign the guestbook on my blog or give me a WUL 
on IGN.

http://club.ign.com/b/about?username=berserker_kev&which=boards

It is very true that I write these kind of guides as a hobby, but just that 
little email that lets me know that I have helped someone always makes me feel 
special for about five minutes.  Don't worry, I won't tell anyone on the gaming 
boards that you used a guide. ;)

Please note that my PSN and Xbox 360 gamertags are mainly meant for messaging 
purposes.  I may not always add/keep you as a friend if you submit a friend 
request.  If you do send a friend request then send me a message along with it 
or I'll probably deny it.

*******************************************************************************
                                   ABOUT ME                              [AM00]
*******************************************************************************

                     "I AM WHAT THE GAMES HAVE MADE ME!"

My name is Kevin Hall.  I'm 28 years old and live in the US, in a small town in 
Mississippi.  Ever since I was really young, I have been a huge fan of video 
games since I was first introduced to them via the Atari 2600 and NES 8-bit.  
My favorite gaming series is the Resident Evil series followed closely by the 
Castlevania series.  I'm a complete horror gaming junkie - survival horrors are 
my main cup of tea.  Capcom is my favorite video game company.  They hardly 
ever let me down when it comes to games with plenty of replay value.

I enjoy being creative and hopefully that shows in my guides, specifically this 
one, since I have put quite a bit of work into it.  Whenever I sit down to 
write a guide, I truly get "in the zone" and my perfectionist nature takes 
over.  My constant goal is to impress myself with my own work and that is one 
very hard task to accomplish since, well... I am never satisfied.  I could 
easily see myself writing guides like this for years to come.  If any gaming 
company happens to read this and needs a strategy guide writer then please 
contact me!

My known aliases are Berserker, berserker_kev, and Berserker93, though 
"Berserker" or "Kev" is preferred.  If you ever surf the IGN Resident Evil or 
Castlevania boards or the Arctic Nightfall boards then look for me!  I usually 
only post up info on my blog now however, but I still move between the listed 
boards every now and then.

Here are a few other bits of information about me:
