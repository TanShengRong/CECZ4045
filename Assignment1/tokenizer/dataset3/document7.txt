Wait, is it already October?Nothing to do with Earth, Wind & Fire’s iconic song, this new café called “September” has opened at the top floor of Beauty World Centre, one month later than expected. I was pretty surprised that September has chosen to open in the quiet Beauty World Centre, instead of say the bustling Cheong Chin Nam Road opposite with a higher volume of foot traffic.(Other cafes around the same area include Caffe Pastore and Shen & Co cafe, if you are keen to explore more.)The 25 seaters space is beautifully decked in blue, white and gold, in resonance to the birthstone and colour of the month – Sapphire and blue respectively.The menu ranges from traditional local dishes such as Nasi Lemak ($7.90), Mee Siam ($4), Mee Rebus ($4), Laksa ($4.50), Toast with Kaya/ Peanut Butter ($2) to hipster cafe food such as Puffy Omelette ($9.90), Yogurt Puffy Omelette ($10.90), Bo Bo Cup Cake ($4.90) and Mini Soufflé Cheesecake ($4.80).I ordered the September Puffy Omelette ($9.90) which usually takes 20 minutes to prepare, though I ended up waiting for 45 minutes due to initial operation kinks.好久 “Hao Jiu”….With that said, the wait was quite worth it.The Puffy Omelette was considerably soft, airy, bouncy and fluffy, with a golden-brown surface (like an omelette) that added a slight crisp to the overall texture.I would say this is a cross between a Soufflé pancake and a Castella cake that is filled with egg fragrance.Hold on, is Castella cake still in trend?Served with whipping cream and strawberries and blueberries by the side and dusted with icing sugar, I finished the entire Puffy Omelette within minutes as it was light and tasty.Apart from the items listed on the menu, September offers seasonal items on display such as the Bo Bo Cup Cake ($4.90, a shortcake in a bubble tea cup, with flavours such as Strawberry and Chocolate.The Strawberry Bo Bo Cup Cake ($4.90) is essentially a strawberry shortcake in a cup.In terms of toppings, there were diced dragonfruit, strawberries, chocolate balls, moist and buttery sponge cake and mainly, whipping cream.I do not have anything against whipping cream, but having it for both the Puffy Omelette and the Bo Bo Cup Cake was probably too much to handle.The drinks menu is also differentiated into traditional local drinks such as Kopi/ Teh ($1.50), Milo ($1.60), Yuan Yang ($1.70) and hipster Infused Tea ($5.90) – Earl Grey, Ginger Pear, Oriental Sencha, Chamomile, Lemongrass.The Roselle ($2.50) similar to Hibiscus tea in terms of its tangy, berry-like taste and mixture of sweet and citrus notes was decent as a thirst quencher.The most memorable dish at September would be the unique Puffy Omelette that is not common in cafes locally.I am already looking forward to the Yogurt version that they will be launching in the future, hopefully not in September, next year.September 玖月
